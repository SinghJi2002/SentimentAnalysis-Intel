India,5,"I brought this processor for my gaming/workstation build .Combining this processor with nzxt 360 mm liquid cooling AIO , things went smoothly.It can handle literally all heavy tasks like 3d rendering , simulation , gaming , yet keeps temprature at 40c .Highly recommended for best gaming rigs .Note: 4th gen ssd is a plus for the build ... Otherwise there might be bottleneck with gen3 ssds while doing 3d rendering works .",This processor is a beast 🔥,i9 12th Gen,i9

France,5,Bien,Produit conforme à la demande.,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,5,"I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers.","The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load.",i9 12th Gen,i9
Japan,5,"I purchase this CPU 1 year ago and it cost me 74,000 JPY back then.the price didn't drop much since that time and the performance is satisfying so far.the new generation spec is higher so if you want to buy this CPU don't. instead, you can buy i7 Gen13 as it will have the same spec plus a better cache than the 12 Gen.it might be better to buy the K version in case you have issues with your GPU to troubleshoot.",all wat I needed for the next coming 5 years,i9 12th Gen,i9
United Kingdom,5,Bought for a friend's computer I was building. I got it in the Prime sale and it's fantasticly fast,Great CPU,i9 12th Gen,i9
Canada,5,This CPU has 24 threads and 16 cores (8E cores and 8P cores) which really makes difference when dealing with 3d graphics and to prevent bottleneck issuesDoesn't cause a CPU and GPU bottleneck as I only get about 45% GPU usage and stay under 10% load in most AAA titles like Destiny or Call of Duty.CinebenchR23 BenchmarksUsing CINEBENCH R23 I got a score of 27552 which is roughly 70 % of top performing CPU score of  43640.Using Geek Bench 6 testI got a Single core score of 2601 which is roughly 83 % of top performing CPU score of  3097 And a multi-core score of 12821 which is roughly 56 % of top performing CPU score of  21742,A performance Beast CPU,i9 12th Gen,i9
Japan,4,"Low binned CPU, bad CPU score",Made in China,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,4,Is 50c high?  Feels like it to me... under really heavy loads barley his 60. I have liquid cooling cpu & gpu aids and 9 fans.  Still seems high IDK,runs hot,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,4,"Came packaged kinda poorly, and didn’t include the golden coin case, which makes me think maybe it was pre owned. When I opened the packaging though it had no paste on it and the pins looked brand new, so maybe they just don’t include it anymore since it isn’t the newest flag ship??","Works great so far, maybe pre owned??",i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,4,"I bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores. There is a price difference to consider. As many know, more cores doesn't necessarily mean better. Games only use a max of 6 cores, though it may vary from game to game. If you just want to game, buy the i7 series. My 4790k had served me so well, it's still my backup on my old mobo. It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy.For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit. Multi-tasking also sees benefit, though that's limited to the hard drive it's working off of. Still, I expect great things in the far future.The packaging is a keeper to be sure, too.",So many cores to use!,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,4,"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k. Given the option to do it over, I would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about $250.",Not worth it over the 12700k IMHO,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,4,"Aside from the nightmare Alder Lake is with ram clocking, this thing does everything you need to. Consistently hits 5.1 - 5.2ghz when needed.Don't listen to the AMD fanboys who try to slander this chip for its heating. I literally just have a 240mm AIO and it doesn't go above 78° and when gaming never even touches 70°. Just do 5 seconds of research on a half decent air cooler or AIO and you're fine with temps",Just about the best gaming chip you don't need!,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,4,"Very excited to get up and running, came in OG box sealed. Took a long time to get but very pleased",Love this,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,3,I bought this thinking it came with the whole case and everything but it came in a cheap little box that was half crushed.,Good performance but missing the whole box,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,3,ordered a new intel i9-12900k processor and the box was fine and sealed and all appeared to be normal with it not opened. Removed the cpu and placed into motherboard ( new lga 1700 mb with the latest bios ). booted up the system and it reported and showed a Celeron G6900. This is unacceptable. Working with amazon support on returning it now. for the replacement unit I will video opening the box and the cpu as it is removed.  Have not had this issue before with a sealed box.,"ordered new cpu , got a Celeron g6900 in the box. be careful",i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,5,This thing was so patient with me as I turned it on without a cooler several times because my pump was failing. Sure it shut off when it hit ~102 Celsius but there was no long term damage and now it serves me well with a working pump. We love to see it.,Absolute Saint,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,5,"Bought this CPU on sale, and it runs fast and stays cool. Mine is running at 5.2 ghz with temps in the 40's on AIO on an ASRock Z790m ITX. I am super impressed at this combination of speed and reasonable temps. Have not gamed yet, but I expect killer performance!!",Great CPU - POWER,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,5,"Using this to serve movies and shows using PLEX, handles continuous recording of several 4K surveillance cameras using Blue Iris, runs a web server (just for family), and controls a Z-wave home automation program involving several nodes. I also use it listen to my collection of music. It does all of these tasks (along with other minor things) without a sweat. Generally it keeps under 15% utilization. Thank you Intel!",It's a work horse,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,5,I only used laptops up to this point and this is my first PC build however I got this processor specifically for Workstation class computation and high performance gaming. The Core i9-12900K is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65W~80W in the games I have played so far. It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace. I would say the Core i5-12600K is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming. I highly recommend this processor or anything in the 12th gen Alder Lake family.Full System Specs:・ASUS Prime Z690-A・Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black・Intel Core i9-12900K 5.2GHz・NVIDIA RTX A5000 24GB ECC・G.Skill Trident Z5 RGB 32GB 5600MHz・Samsung 980 PRO 2TB M.2 NVMe・Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMe・Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMe・Samsung 970 EVO Plus 2TB M.2 NVMe・EVGA Super Nova G5 850W 80 Plus Gold・Fractal Torrent Gray E-ATX Mid Tower Case,Insanely fast computation!,i9 12th Gen,i9

United States,5,Awesome Cpu blazzzing fast !!!!!!  for gaming and other  tasks . i see that the temps for this cpu work up into the 70's and even higher 80 + my recommendation is to undervote your cpu if your just gaming that will lower temps. With good thermal paste Kingpin cooling KPX and a water cooler im getting 55-58c in gaming hope it helps.,i9 Smooths as butter!,i9 12th Gen,i9
United States,5,The processor is amazing. Upgraded from an Intel 8700k.  Paired it with 6400 mhz DDR5 memory on a AsRock z690 Taichi motherboard  and my Nvidia EVGA 3080Ti and I'm consistently in the top 5% of benchmarks world-wide with barely any tweeks except selecting the XMP profile in my bios.

Canada,5,"This thing never goes over 15 percent usage, and most games its actually using 0-4 percent. Even on Escape From Tarkov at max settings 4k 140+ fps its using 4 percent at max and usually is at 0-1 percent, I don't know if it's my computer reading an error but I use a few apps to check including the task manager tab. I use an NZXT AIO and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when I'm gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s. I tried WOW classic, Retail,  Cyberpunk, Spiderman , and regularly play Escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage. My GPU barely works as I have a 3090 TI, my GPU is usually at USAGE 40-50 percent at max 60 percent and stays cool, so I don't think anything is bottle necking.My old computer has an I5 and I have a laptop with an I7 and when I am gaming they are usually at 90+ percent usage. Even my friend with the AMD 5800x3D was getting at least 30+percent usage for AAA games. This is the first Computer I've built where I'm actually not even worried about the CPU for how cool it runs.

Paired up with a Z690 from MSI and a RTX 3090 it's just the perfect combo. 12900K is completely free to do the data processing for the game, and 3090 handles the graphics side in all my triple A titles without needing to borrow from the system memory at all - needing to pull data through the processor.

United States,1,"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU.Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily.

United States,5,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again?

United States,5,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get.

Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load).",Amazing CPU,i9 12th Gen,i9

Like its so overkill for the average user. In for gaming it is just overkill. It is the perfect CPU for me, but also for those who do intensive work loads, such as running running large data models for AI purposes.My particular use case for this CPU was to allow me to build a virtual lab to which I could analyse malware in an virtual sandbox, whilst also emulating real world hacking attacks. At present I am able to run several virtual machines with no performance issues. As you can probably imagine, this power hungry beast can get warm, but with an adequate cooling solution, there should be no issues in keeping the PC nice and cool.  I have paired this CPU with an AIO, and also additional fans for the case to ensure there is a lot of air flow to ensure that the thermals are a good temperature.My advice to anybody purchasing this CPU - go for it - it's well worth the investment, while at the same time you'll be future proofing your soon to be BEAST of a machine for the next 10 years.",Its a BEAST,i9 13th Gen,i9

On my Asus board, the default setting boosts it to ~310W for a short while causing 102°C on my 360mm Arctic AIO before dropping to something more reasonable. YOU CAN DISABLE THIS and enforce Intel stock 250W limits. Doing this led to no throttling and no crazy 100°C moments. This is not an inferno of a chip, your motherboard makes it one, so carefully check your BIOS settings if that bothers you!I'm happy that this chip does phenomenally in gaming and productivity both, so I can easily recommend it.

When running tasks like having Opera open with even 30 tabs, Spotify, file browser and settings all open at the same time, my temps max at 34 degrees Celsius.

It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.

United States,5,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.

Canada,1,"I have had soooo many stability issues it is unreal.  I originally purchased the i9 13900k, did no overclocking but had soooo much trouble with the system that I stupidly replaced the mainboard and video card.  I didn't refund as I assumed that I had done the damage.  Literally months of troubleshooting and doubled expenses before I realized that the asus mainboard defaulted to super high wattage and the chip itself began to degrade at an extremely fast rate.  Yet again assuming that I must have done something wrong I ordered this replacement chip, to find issues suddenly occuring again.  This is about when the news dropped on mainboard suppliers and intel passing the buck on an inherently co dependant series of faults that have personally cost thousands upon thousands of dollars.I'm an IT professional, have been in the industry for more than 20 years, and have never encountered a situation so costly for the end consumer.I really hate to say it, I hold stocks in intel, I've loved them as a brand and considered them to be a number one choice, I can no longer say this.I honestly think there should be a class action lawsuit over this chip and it's predecessorI had to purchase 2  rtx 4090 and 2 asus mainboards before I could even lock down this issue.I hate to say it but if I'd gone with a competitor I would have saved multiple thousands of dollars.","until the kinks are worked out, not even a little bit worth the price.",i9 14th Gen,i9

United States,4,"I built 3 systems using 14900 series. They all had serious stability problems when in use.  After researching for weeks and reinstalling OS with no better result.  I finally disabled overclocking ""AI overclocking"", which was running as high as 1.6v.  I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.  Adobe CS uses my 3080ti and the intel quicksync iGPU simultaneously which rarely went above 40%, and usually was around 15-20 when editing.  HW encodes for HD were at 350fps, software, 250, intel 300.  So a small advantage in Adobe CS is why I went with the 14900K vs KF.System was using ""AI overclocking"" pushing it to 6.2 roughly single core.

Multitasking, gaming, and content creation have all seen a significant improvement. Multithreaded applications and gaming experiences run smoother.  It's a productivity powerhouse. The clock speeds are no slouch either, making it excellent for single-threaded tasks and gaming. The major downside of this CPU is the heat it generates. Even with a high-end cooling solution, it tends to run hot, and that's something you must take into consideration when setting up your cooling solution.

United States,5,"A lot of people are upset with the 14900k because of the minimal performance leap thar came between it and the 13900k. I say who cares. If you have a 13900k, don't upgrade, but if you have an older PC or 12th Gen, this is a worthy upgrade. I absolutely love mine. It's a monster of a CPU.I honestly don't recommend air cooling it. It can get pretty hot and there are only a small handful of air coolers that can handle this 14900k without setting power limits (which most people don't know how to do, let alone even know what that means)If you're not doing a custom water loop to cool your 14900k, I recommend you do what I've done to cool mine, you dont neeeed to, but it helps. I have an AIO (All-In-One Cooler) and I setup a push-pull configuration on my radiator. That means I have 3 fans on the bottom blowing in through the radiator, and 3 more fans blowing up and out of the case. Both are blowing upward. It creates more airflow. One side is pushing the air, the other side is helping pull that air through. Then I got a thermalright contact frame. Any LGA 1700 contact frame should work but the thermalright version is cheap. It might say 12th/13th Gen but it will also work on 14th Gen. So get an AIO, setup a push-pull fan configuration and get a contact frame. It's helping my Temps significantly.

United States,5,"I'm not going to go over the same performance reviews others have done, yes its very fast for only $550 its the king of the poor mans build PC. my last PC its replacing was a $1000 10980xe and looking at the numbers the 14900k in average is 70-77% faster than the 10980xe. the only disadvantage between the 2 was the 10980xe had 48 PCIe lanes and ran 32c to 56c hot.i can't say the same about the 14900k heat, its spreader is almost half of the 10980xe. you can't just simply add a stock cooler or a ""MC'watercooler"" and expect the problem will solve itself. this is the first CPU in my 26 yrs of building PC's you have to plan out your cooler set up.ever since a 2012 water leak from these Mc'watercoolers (all in one 2 fan radiator kits sold by name brands) Ive never trusted them cost me $1500 in damages. The only water coolers that don't leak for me were the ones i built but water cooling is expensive and you have to inspect them at least every 3 months for debris in the tank or leaks. with air i only have to clean the pc 2x a year.yes you can control temps with an air cooler, and get the same temps as a 3 fan radiator water cooler.

United States,5,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance. When I booted up the new machine and tried my Ableton DAW  for the first time, I was expecting to be so happy with a performance boost, and the software was literally almost unusable.! The E-cores were slowing the software down so bad, I could barely change settings in the preferences.! It was that bad.

However, it's power-hungry and may require robust cooling solutions. Overall, it's a top choice for enthusiasts and power users seeking uncompromising performance.",Best cpu,i9 14th Gen,i9
United States,5,"Before you purchase this CPU please also purchase alongside of it purchase a 360 AiO as well, this CPU is in need of it. I'm not trying to say that to scare you but it runs warm. In my (asus) bios I turned on ""Disabled-Enforce all limits"" so that the motherboard doesn't try to do on the fly OC to keep temps low and stability up. I haven't had any crashes or stability issues at all. I did a full platform upgrade from the 10900k to this, I kept my RTX 3080 and the performance bump was actually fully noticeable. I'd say my average temperature for doing basic computing is around 37c with my Lian Li Galahad II Trinity 360. It's a monster of a CPU genuinely and if you are in the market for an upgrade don't hesitate you won't regret it.",Powerful but Warm,i9 14th Gen,i9
United States,5,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.  Just having fun, do what you love!I don't blame Amazon, Intel, AMD, or Nvidia more than the other. Manufacturing and shipping issues happen. The chip I received from Amazon didn't meet my expectations, but my other purchases have been exceptional. By chance alone, the other four 14900Ks I've received from various distributors have been stellar!Note:Settings in pictures are daily driven....No stability concerns all AIDIA 64 Stress tested for multiple hours and hundreds of gaming/workload hours.

United States,5,"Sorta came from a 13900k but I gave that to a relative after their x299/i9-7940x system began to have issues. He bought a z790 board and was amazed how far ahead the 13900k is in comparison an overclocked Skylake-X processor. He fixed the issue with the x299 system, but he decided to stay with Raptor Lake. All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom. I already set all P-cores to 5.8GHz, while keeping the double-core Turbo Boost at 6.0GHz. I also set the cache to 5.2Ghz and it's completely stable. I was not able to raise the multiplier at all with my 13900k. Just happy my 14900k isn't a lottery loser.While the clock of both the 13900ks and 14900k are the same, the 13900ks has a cherry picked memory controller. If you're looking to do a ton of RAM overclocking then the 13900ks may be the way to go.... but that's not to say if you'd get a 14900k with a good memory controller. Both my 13900k and 14900k work with DDR5-7200 RAM with XMP set, and no adjustments to the memory controller voltages.If you're buying the 14900k off the get-go and building a new system around it, then I recommend pairing it with a motherboard that has the BIOS Flashback feature.",So far so good.,i9 14th Gen,i9

My station is primarily used as a work station though it scores well with PC Mark 10 and cinebench. 3D Mark declares the obvious that I need to upgrade my video card from several years ago. The ai over clocking helps in the bench marking significantly. Lot easier to overclock than in the early 2000's on my core 2quad.
