United Kingdom,3,"This is a pretty powerful, modern Intel processor which I bought when replacing my gaming PC.On this front, me and Intel agree and are friends, it was in fact a powerful enough processor for most forms of gaming, which was easy to install.However, do NOT use the stock cooler that comes with this thing!If you just want to run your average PC game (FF14, Halo, etc) then you'll find it is strong enough to handle that without breaking a sweat.However, if you are intending to do video or photo editing, or God forbid emulation, then you'll find yourself with the loudest, most ineffective fan I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing.When I fast forward games in PCSX2, it can reach 90C which is 30 above what my previous computer's stock cooler would keep it locked at under any circumstances.I would tell you how hot it got trying to run RPCS3 but I immediately went for Task Manager to close the application after I saw it hit 100C!TL;DR: If you intend to use more than 30% of this processor's true capability, you cannot just use the cooler that comes with it.Extremely disappointing, and I'm kicking myself for not researching this more thoroughly, as I had erroneously thought from past experience that it could handle basic tasks without sounding like a helicopter taking off.",Do NOT use the stock cooler!,i5 12th Gen,en
United Kingdom,3,"The CPU is perfect and amazing im not going to lie about that and it works as it was expected and even higher then that, in Fortnite i went from 110fps to 312fps and that REALLY SHOCKED ME because thats a big jump and it is Amazing how GOOD this CPU is so i am Really Happy about it but the reason i did not give it 5 starts is due to when it arrived at my house and i unboxed it, 1 prepeller of my CPU Fan was broken and i tried contacting but i coulnt not fix the issue so i have to live with 1 part of the Fan missing and due to that it makes alot of sound when it speeds up so i have to buy a PU Fan septuratly, so not very happy on that end but a Very Good CPU in general and dont leave it just because you read this review lol im just unlucky the CPU is REALLY GOOD trust me.",Amazing CPU but not the fan....,i5 12th Gen,en

India,4,"The cpu is overall great for everything, it’ll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming. If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesn’t. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you don’t have an ac in your room, aio is the choice.",Great process but pathetic Stock cooler,i5 12th Gen,en

Belgium,4,"I love this cpu and its price tag. It can handle the newest games well and works quite well for graphic design applications. The only issue I have with this is your ram is locked to a maximum of 3200mhz. If you want to get it higher, consider a 12400KF",Very good 6 core,i5 12th Gen,en

United Kingdom,5,I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :),Bargain priced CPU - low power draw with great productivity and gaming performance! :),i5 12th Gen,en
Sweden,5,"Switched from 6th gen i5 (6600k) to 12400f, I can feel the significant improvement. Especially with daily tasks and games it works perfectly. I got ddr5 6000mhz cl30 ram as well, works without a problem. Combined with 4060 ti, consumes such little power and gets everything i need done so far.I got a noctua cooler for it though, works really quiet and cool. Perfect for the price. About 500sek cheaper than the version with integrated graphics, but there are low profile gpus in case you want it as a simple daily or office use.",It goes brrrr,i5 12th Gen,en
United Kingdom,5,"Was going for a top end 1080p build and from all the reviews I’d read, the 12400F seemed like the best option. Easy to instal. Came with a cooling fan although I chose to use a bigger air cooler.",Perfect For My Build,i5 12th Gen,en
United Kingdom,5,"I am not a gamer but like to keep reasonably up to date and this intel cpu fits the bill for me. Its fast and works well with my motherboard. Reasonably priced for what it does, the cooler provided is ok for my needs as well but can get a bit noisy when the cpu remains at high % for some time. But overall very happy with this processor.",Good performance,i5 12th Gen,en
