United Kingdom,3,"This is a pretty powerful, modern Intel processor which I bought when replacing my gaming PC.On this front, me and Intel agree and are friends, it was in fact a powerful enough processor for most forms of gaming, which was easy to install.However, do NOT use the stock cooler that comes with this thing!If you just want to run your average PC game (FF14, Halo, etc) then you'll find it is strong enough to handle that without breaking a sweat.However, if you are intending to do video or photo editing, or God forbid emulation, then you'll find yourself with the loudest, most ineffective fan I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing.When I fast forward games in PCSX2, it can reach 90C which is 30 above what my previous computer's stock cooler would keep it locked at under any circumstances.I would tell you how hot it got trying to run RPCS3 but I immediately went for Task Manager to close the application after I saw it hit 100C!TL;DR: If you intend to use more than 30% of this processor's true capability, you cannot just use the cooler that comes with it.Extremely disappointing, and I'm kicking myself for not researching this more thoroughly, as I had erroneously thought from past experience that it could handle basic tasks without sounding like a helicopter taking off.",Do NOT use the stock cooler!,i5 12th Gen,i5

India,4,"The cpu is overall great for everything, it’ll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming. If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesn’t. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you don’t have an ac in your room, aio is the choice.",Great process but pathetic Stock cooler,i5 12th Gen,i5

United Kingdom,5,I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :),Bargain priced CPU - low power draw with great productivity and gaming performance! :),i5 12th Gen,i5

Combined with 4060 ti, consumes such little power and gets everything i need done so far.I got a noctua cooler for it though, works really quiet and cool. Perfect for the price.

Canada,5,"Words cannot describe the change in performance.I thought my 9600k was still a decent chip before I upgraded. Now I see although it was decent, I was missing a lot. My rtx 2080 super didn’t get upgraded this year but I’m sure it’ll need to by next year as it’s now always peaked at 100% in games. While my gpu works a sweat trying to not burn itself to the ground, this 13600k sits around 20-30% usage and around 50 degrees Celsius in most situations.Depending on the motherboard, you may want to tweak “CPU lite load” settings. My MSI mobo defaulted to mode 12 and was causing overheating issues due to current.

United States,3,"The Intel Core i5-13600K is the latest champion in the mid-range desktop processor arena, promising top-notch gaming performance and efficient multitasking. But does it reign supreme, or face dethronement by rivals? Let's sharpen our critical swords and delve into its strengths and weaknesses:Pros:Performance Powerhouse: 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) and 20 threads deliver exceptional performance for gaming, content creation, and demanding workloads. Compared to its predecessor, the 12600K, it offers a significant performance leap.Gaming Prowess: Tears through even the most graphically demanding games with ease, boasting high frame rates and smooth gameplay at 1080p and beyond.Multitasking Maestro: Handles heavy multitasking like a champ, effortlessly juggling multiple applications, browser tabs, and demanding tasks simultaneously.Overclocking Champion: Unlocked multiplier allows for enthusiast-level overclocking, squeezing even more performance out of the silicon for those seeking ultimate power.DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 Support: Future-proofed with support for the latest DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 technology, ensuring compatibility with cutting-edge hardware upgrades.Cons:Power Hungry Prince: This performance comes at a cost, with a higher TDP (125W) and potential for increased power consumption compared to lower-power alternatives.Temperature Tantrums: Can run hot under heavy load, requiring beefy cooling solutions to maintain optimal performance and prevent thermal throttling.Pricey Pedigree: Carries a premium price tag compared to some Ryzen 5 competitors offering similar performance in certain scenarios.Windows 11 Preference: While technically compatible with Windows 10, Intel recommends Windows 11 for optimal performance and feature utilization.Motherboard Matchmaking: Requires a newer LGA 1700 motherboard, adding to the overall upgrade cost.Verdict:The Intel Core i5-13600K is a force to be reckoned with in the mid-range gaming processor category. Its exceptional performance, overclocking potential, and future-proof compatibility make it a tempting choice for serious gamers and creators. However, the higher power consumption, price tag, and potential thermal issues require careful consideration.Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars (with a slight temperature-related deduction)Should You Buy It?Absolutely! If you're a hardcore gamer or demanding content creator seeking the best value for performance in the mid-range, and aren't afraid of a little thermal taming, the 13600K is a top contender.Consider alternatives: If budget, power consumption, or Windows 10 compatibility are major concerns, explore Ryzen 5 options or consider the slightly less powerful (and cooler) i5-13500.",The King of Mid-Range Gaming?

The final piece of my new build was 32gb of corsair vengeance and I couldn't be happier unless I won the lotto.If you just need a solid gaming chip and don't want to break the bank, run, don't walk, to get this in your system today.BTW, I built my system using an ASUS ROG STRIX mITX, in an nr200p case and the Mugen 5 rev C does a great job keeping it cool using MX-6 thermal paste. The best part? It all fits neatly on my desk in my room. If you were waiting to build a new computer, now is the time. A 13th gen processor, DDR5 ram, a decent video card and a few SSDs and you'll be all set for the rest of the decade.",Amazing processor!,i5 13th Gen,i5

United States,5,"I bought this to build a gaming pc with. But I like CPUs that have a graphics option. This gives me a little wiggle room when I'm debugging a system. When I'm putting it together, I can get the mother board assembly out without plugging in a GPU.I'm using this in a pc that primarily plays World of Warcraft. A core I5 is plenty for that. I'm sure an I3 is more than adequate. I'm using a Deep Cool cooler in a well ventilated case and it doesn't get above 72 degrees celsius, 51 degrees over ambient. I'm not a CPU snob and have used AMD and Intel equally over the years. I wanted thunderbolt ports and that pretty much limited me to Intel this go around. I am not disappointed.

As long as you pair it with a motherboard that doesn't hold back the power that is this processor.",Love at first game ( After RIG upgrade),i5 13th Gen,i5
United States,5,"There's really not much that needs to be said. If you're upgrading to 13th gen Intel, and don't require the additional non-gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k, you can't go wrong with the i5-13600k. Even with XMP enabled to 6000Mhz & a Noctua NH-U12A tower cooler on top, this beast never gets truly hot in any game. Granted, I have a very good case for airflow, but regardless it's extremely rare I ever see this CPU hitting the 70's when gaming (this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings), with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that. I paired this beastly CPU with the Sapphire Nitro Plus Radeon 6950XT & have been having an amazing experience all around. If you're deeply considering 13th gen, & your main focus is gaming, then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end SKU's give off. Genuinely give this CPU a 10/10, never in my life did I ever anticipate an i5 to be this great, but just goes to show it's more about the generation and less about the number after the i. If you're considering the CPU but unsure as to its performance, I promise you wont be disappointed with it one bit. Including with its temperatures.

This thing is a little devil in benchmarks, and for $300(at least) less than the 13900k, you can have a processor that stays in punching distance when gaming. Absolutely killer value of you want to build a gaming rig with a quality processor that doesn't eat $600.

I stood up a Plex docker container and added my footage and this CPU handles transcoding and streaming my videos no problem and it's great to go back and easily re-live some of those storms.We also have a growing library of TV shows and Movies and it also handles streaming those as well.I imagine this CPU would be awesome for gaming as well, but I don't have any experience with this chip and gaming but there are plenty of reviews that do go over that.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and would easily recommend this chip to anyone building a media server.","Very fast, Lots of Cores, Great transcoding",i5 13th Gen,i5

At 70 fewer watts than the i9-13900K you can actually cool the thing on air and enjoy similar single core performance, and with a respectable multicore performance score as well.My chip actually runs faster than Passmark says it should, but that might be because of my RAM. I got the K chip to get faster DDR5 speeds, not faster clock speeds, since I'm on air cooled, but at 5.1GHz I'm not for want of more cycles.My last CPU was an AMD Ryzen 7 4750G. Respectable for its day, but when I saw the performance of this Intel I decided it was time for me to switch back.My recommendation is that if you're running an air cooled gaming system, strongly consider this chip even if you have the cash for a 13th gen i9.

You do not want to cheap out on a cooling solution or else you'll be leaving performance on the table.Only gripe with this cpu is the fact that intel markets this as a 14 core cpu, even when the e-cores aren't exactly a big deal in game.

United States,4,"After too many years of gaming on an old i7-6700K I finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year.  I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again.","Great CPU, but hard to cool",i7 13th Gen,i7

Everything opens almost instantly, whether it be Windows 11's File Explorer, Edge browser and webpages, and opening files in general.  I upgraded primarily because I am a developer, and Visual Studio + Dotfuscator would take almost 8 minutes to compile and obfuscate my largest program on my old build.  After upgrading, it now compiles in about 4 mins 45 seconds.  The longest part is Dotfuscator, not Visual Studio compiling.

United States,5,"I built a new computer during the height of covid (Dummy, I know, right?) and decided on a i9-9900k. I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c. And no, I have not done the Contact Plate mod.TL;DR - This CPU is blazing fast, and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade. I don't claim to be Steve from Gamers Nexus, or a pro CPU tester - but I can tell you that this thing is amazing, and will serve you well for years to come.",Who needs an i9!

United States,5,"The i7-13700K has i7-12900K performance at an i7 range price range. Please note I used an older Z690 EVGA Classified Board. I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboard’s vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMD’s expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intel’s 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me). I also like to note the CPU fits only fits one way and the CPU lever has a bit of tension, so don’t be afraid when installing your CPU.",Fantastic Performance/Value Workstation CPU,i7 13th Gen,i7

The 13700k is the best value CPU if you require enough speed for high-end gaming + productivity (e.g. video editing/rendering, streaming, multitasking, etc). This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt.

United States,5,"In general - all mentioned in this review products are as described and working as described. Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.Items used in this build:--Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/Very good case – compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included – actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.--Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/-Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole.--Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.--Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/- Good CPU, working well in gaming.--Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.--Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/-Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync.--Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:a)  MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/b) Intel Core i9-13900KF,  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX™ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games.--Item 8) SSD Disks:8.1) Primary (system): WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe Gen4 PCIe M.2 2280 WDS200T2X0E, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7CMZ3QH/8.2) Secondary (backup and media data): Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 CT4000P3PSSD8, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B25M8FXX/- Very good products, works as described, no problems.--Item 9) Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable, PSU Cables, PSU Extension Cable Kit / 1x24pin ATX / 2x8pin (4+4) EPS / 3X (6+2) pin PCI-E, 30cm Length with Combs, Dual EPS Red Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BN3H2K17/- Perfect fit for this project, good cables, looks nice.--Item 10)CPU cooler: ID-COOLING IS-67-XT Black 67mm Height Low Profile CPU Cooler, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFPY9CKZ/- Good design, keeps i7-13700K adequately cool in open Air PC Case. Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).--Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 Halo² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.---Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.--Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/-----------Overall, I assume the goal is reached - the presented system can play recent games and look very cool (in my humble opinion).","Good CPU, working well in gaming",i7 13th Gen,i7

United States,1,"I've been a lifetime Intel diehard fan but man they really pushed a disappointing product out. This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down.I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU.I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot. That's not the case anymore and I'm so disappointed because Intel was my go to with every single PC I ever built.",BEWARE of the New LGA 1700 Socket,i7 14th Gen,i7

If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version.",Please note that the F in the 14700KF means NO iGPU,i7 14th Gen,i7

United States,5,"I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers.","The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load.",i9 12th Gen,i9

It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy.For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit.

Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k.

United States,1,"I've put together a few systems and run some retail 12900k chips so far and the 12900k is by far an amazingly fast CPU.Unfortunately this one I ordered from Amazon came already opened. As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with. It should be VERY firm and unable to just pull open easily. Look at the condition of the box itself around that area and even the gold disk inside.Fresh, brand new i9 12900k's are very pristine and boxed with precision.Still, they are fantastic processors overall and a worthy upgrade from 10th and 11th gen.",Unit was previously opened....,i9 12th Gen,i9

United States,5,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again? I'd probably buy the 13th generation, but if I had any sense I'd just get the 13th gen i7.",Not necessary for everyone,i9 12th Gen,i9

United States,5,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get.

United States,5,"Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load).",Amazing CPU,i9 12th Gen,i9

At present I am able to run several virtual machines with no performance issues. As you can probably imagine, this power hungry beast can get warm, but with an adequate cooling solution, there should be no issues in keeping the PC nice and cool.  I have paired this CPU with an AIO, and also additional fans for the case to ensure there is a lot of air flow to ensure that the thermals are a good temperature.My advice to anybody purchasing this CPU - go for it - it's well worth the investment, while at the same time you'll be future proofing your soon to be BEAST of a machine for the next 10 years.",Its a BEAST,i9 13th Gen,i9

On my Asus board, the default setting boosts it to ~310W for a short while causing 102°C on my 360mm Arctic AIO before dropping to something more reasonable. YOU CAN DISABLE THIS and enforce Intel stock 250W limits. Doing this led to no throttling and no crazy 100°C moments.

It is more of an sideways change rather than an upgrade.The i9-14900K is fast but not more so that a i9-13900K.  For me, the Cinebench R23 scores are about the same for 13th versus 14th gen.  Though the i9-14900K appears to run DDR5 more stably and at higher frequencies than the i9-13900K.  Also, the i9-14900K is enabled for XTU AI enable tuning in XTU but it's not that helpful.  I even wonder if it is worth getting a K at all, these CPU's are plenty fast for gaming without overclocking.I did NOT notice a significant improvement in the operating temperatures.  Maybe a slight improvement but I did flush out the cooling system and clean out the water block so I am doubtful that the running temps are better.  Also, I suggest that you NOT let these chips get anywhere near TjMax (100C).  I had one i9-13900KF literally fail due to allowing it to get to TjMax frequently when stress testing.  A second one became slightly flaky.I thought the built in ARC display support of the K version might be helpful since I intended to devote the graphics card to the gaming monitor and use the built-in ARC on a side display.  But as it turns out, it wasn't worth it for me.  If you are gaming with this level of processor, you really need a comparable graphics card but most of them will drive four displays.  IMO, you are better off getting a KF and spending the money so saved on better graphics card.The original asking price was insane, I bought it on a whim on a late night.  On the morning morning after, I had buyers remorse, tried to cancel but could not, so instead, I refused the package.  It took literally 6 months to get a refund.  That was rather irksome.",Possibly better memory support than i9-13900K,i9 14th Gen,i9

Whatever the case, I'm not the only one seeing this behavior - it's unacceptable.Update: Reducing the e-cores to 4.3 helps significantly, and setting everything to 5.5/4.3 (13900k values) solves it completely. Simply too much voltage is being pumped into the chip at stock frequencies.

United States,5,"So far so good.  This CPU is a monster and runs very nicely and boosts to max clocks (6ghz on two cores and 5.7ghz on all cores) unlimited TDP settings but thermally limited at 90c with -60mV offset.  I have noticed that it runs a bit cooler than my previous 13900KF, especially when you consider the core to core deltas.  I use my PC mostly for gaming and encoding, so as long as you have a great case with plenty of air flow and a top notch cooler, you can easily run it air cooled without issues as it will just throttle itself when it hits whatever thermal maximum you set in the UEFI BIOS.In gaming workloads it never throttles though and stays at 5.7ghz all core boost the entire time with temps in CPU intensive games anywhere from the upper 50s to mid 60s and upper 40s to mid 50s in non CPU intensive games**Update**I have the CPU now at 5.8ghz with HT disabled and a -75mV offset and it's working like a charm and very stable in gaming workloads and encoding (it downclocks when it hits 90c for encoding workloads but for gaming it stays at 5.8ghz), which is amazing since it's on an air cooled setup, though the setup is as optimal as it gets for air cooling!  As for temps, they are a little lower than running it at 5.7ghz with HT enabled and a -50mV offset.  If I use a -75mV offset with 5.8ghz and HT enabled, my PC crashes.  So disabling HT definitely enables the CPU to use less power.If you're predominantly using your machine for gaming, then I definitely recommend turning HT off regardless as most games tend to run better with HT disabled.  But if you're using it for productivity or a blend of both productivity and gaming, then definitely turn HT on.The only mildly disappointing thing for me is that the memory controller isn't as good as I thought it would be.  Mine runs 48GB DDR5 7400 CL34 at 1.35V on the IMC, but to hit DDR5 7600 CL36 with stability I need to increase the IMC voltage to 1.41V which just isn't worth it if you ask me for such a minor bump in performance.  My previous 13900KF could do 48GB DDR5 7800 at 1.36V on the IMC.Core wise though, the CPU is definitely superior to 13th gen.",Running air cooled on DeepCool Assassin IV with ease,i9 14th Gen,i9

I also found a BIOS setting after running some tools and set it INTEL FAIL SAFE.  this allowed me to run the AVX2 stress test successfully.  It basically throttles the chip.I can't tell you the frustration this caused figuring this out.  Everything from chrome browsers to Adobe CS would crash randomly for no apparent reason every few minutes while all ""tests"" showed it was fine.  I lowered my refresh rate to 60 from 120, killed AI overclocking and set the INTEL setting and now have a very stable system. It outperforms my 5950x when encoding, which is impressive.  It does run HOT even with water cooling.  IF I had it to do over again, I would avoid 13000 and 14000 chips as there is a OODLE issue as well when it comes to gaming with Unreal 5.  Basically an unfixable hardware flaw that affects some chips.Here's the thing, you will not notice a difference as nothing I use with the exception of HANDBRAKE, ever comes close to maxing out the chip when in use.

United States,5,"So I finally upgraded my home workstation, and went to this new i9-14900K. It is incredibly fast. I had a Davinci Resolve video project file that I rendered on my old setup, the i7-6850K and it took just over 22 minutes to complete the render. On the new i9, the exact same file was re exported, took just over 8 minutes..! almost a 3x speed increase.! Also, when you speed up footage in Resolve, the old cpu could not play it back smoothly, it would jump and chug like crazy, the new i9, it plays it back sped up 800% no problems and I can actually see how it looks without having to export the entire video clip to see it playback the retimed footage smoothly. Applications open u p much faster too, but that could be more due to the pcie4.0 nvme system drive that is much faster than the previous version nvme I had in the old build. The one thing I do not like about the new cpu, is the number of pci lanes. You only get 20, 16 are pcie5.0 and 4 are pcie4.0. This wont be an issue for most people, but my old cpu had 40 lanes, allowing me to run 3 GPU's at the same time, and YES, I needed them, I use GPU rendering software that can use up to 8 GPU's in one system on one license and every additional GPU speeds up your render times a lot when rendering out 3D sims. With this new cpu, I can only run 2 GPU's and they run at 8x, cause they share the 16x, and that does leave me 4 full pcie4.0 lanes for the system drive. It is not a deal breaker, and the increased speed overall is well worth it. One thing EVERYBODY should be aware of, is these new intel chips have P cores and E cores. Something my old cpu did NOT have. E-cores can severely impact certain software performance.

United States,5,"This professional CPU isn't designed for the average user. However, if you're a tinkerer at heart, eager to dive deeper than the surface-level information often presented in YouTube ""videos"" (or should we say, commercials), this is unquestionably for you. I've acquired multiple units for various builds/configurations from a wide array of retailers—Best Buy, Newegg, and others included.For those considering making a purchase, I highly recommend using an Apex/Apex Encore MOBO or another reputable 2 DIMM board, particularly for AM5 or LGA1700, if overclocking is your goal. A high-quality cooler is crucial; for those opting for an AIO, ensure it includes at least an 8th gen Asetek pump and a 360 Thickboy copper radiator with performance fans—Avoid the aesthetically pleasing but functionally inferior Lian Li reversed SL Infinity Fans. Genuine static pressure fans, capable of efficiently doing the job, are what you need. Despite what your favorite YouTuber might suggest, you should prioritize efficiency over aesthetics.When selecting DDR5, opt for GOOD BINNED options. If a high-binned QVL compatible set isn't your choice, at a minimum, go for HYNIX A for single rank and HYNIX M for dual rank.The 14900K, when expertly tuned, becomes a gaming and multitasking powerhouse—achieving 43 to 44k in R23, with 6.2GHz boosting, 5.9GHz across its 8 physical cores and 8 threads, and 16 physical e-cores at 4.7GHz for a total of 32 threads, of which only 8 are virtual. With hyper-threading and e-cores enabled, it supports 8200 to 8400 MTS CL38 DDR5 RAM, boasts sub-55ns bus latency, and sub-9.3ns FWL. It's a marvel in Aida64 full, minus SSD, burn-in stress test stability. Adjusting all cores down to 5.8 and boosting to 6.0 can further reduce bus latency to easily below 50ns...Did I mention overall CPU temperatures typically remain between 35 to 40°C under heavy gaming loads, rarely exceeding 50°C? Despite the capability of 3 EATX connections to easily deliver over 400W of power, I'd advise against exceeding 325W daily, as the performance gains beyond this point are minimal without extreme overclocking and cooling methods—increased voltage requirements could significantly shorten the lifespan of your CPU. For tinkerers, this CPU is a dream come true.As of this date—4-4-2024: We anticipate future silicon manufacturing constraints will evolve, but that's a discussion for another time.The X3D Elephant in the room: Don't worry, I own one, and this is about science, not purchase bias...We'll sidestep intricate discussions about CLDO, FCLK, and MCLK concerns, and why the substantial L3 cache has become an essential workaround for the instability caused by chiplet-based IMC in handling DDR5 for gamers. If the augmentation of the L3 cache wasn't primarily to address DDR5 issues stemming from the chiplet design, why not significantly enhance and accelerate the L1 cache? The design doesn't allow for it since it's not monolithic, which wouldn't be practical. Those well-versed in the subject matter understand this. While chiplets represent the future, we must acknowledge that this future hasn't fully materialized for every aspect of computing, allowing us to look beyond the ""normie YouTuber AMD cults.""Indeed, I own a 7800X3D build and absolutely adore it! It excels in gaming... primarily in GAMING! Thus, there's no cause for concern. Let's briefly touch on the ""benefits"" like reduced thermals and supposed platform longevity (as if motherboard chipset upgrades and advancements in power delivery methods don't occur... humor me, over the planned 6 years). I, too, long for Z390 features on my Z790 board (/end sarcasm), not to mention the potential for longer boot times when tinkering with DDR5 or PBO, or even under normal conditions, and texture stutter/tearing... oops, and all those other delightful topics Lisa tends to highlight without addressing the influence of influencers with communications degrees rather than computer science degrees.

All of which is okay by me because that old 13900k had no overclocking headroom, and I could only undervolt it by 5mv before it became unstable. I was going to buy another 13900k or maybe the ks version, but I decided to wait for the 14900k.The 14900k I got on the other hand has some overclocking headroom.
