India,5,"If you would be building pc just for gaming and slight editing or coding here and there this is perfect and the cost is really low considering what performance it gives, this CPU is by no means a low end CPU dont go gentle with that price the intel 12100f can easily handle GPUs upto gtx3060 or rx6800.

United Kingdom,3,"As per the title, Intel's 12th gen lower tier stock cooler is pants. Don't waste your time installing it.
