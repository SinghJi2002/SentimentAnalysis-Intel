United States,4,"The processor is great and arrived sealed in good condition, however, the cardboard box had no protection and it could easily be damaged if it fell.",Packaging could be improved,Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i5-14600KF,en,i5 14th Gen
United States,4,"I'm definitely gonna upgrade later but this is handling itself pretty well with dragon dogma 2 to fortnite and everything in-between, only gripe is that there's no small arrow on the actual CPU to indicate where to place it on motherboard so if you tossed the packaging without looking you might be bit confused with orientation otherwise good.",Good for price,Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i5-14600KF,en,i5 14th Gen
United States,4,"great cpu, not as powerful as I thought it would be. Ended up going with a 14700k, just seemed a bit laggy even when running at  5.8 all core.. great cpu though and runs cool","great cpu, not as powerful as I thought it would be",Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i5-14600KF,en,i5 14th Gen
United States,5,"I have been amazed on how stable and easily overclocked to such a high number.  Some time I may try to go higher, but for now I can say this CPU is awesome.",Overclocked to 5-GHZ first time!  Wow,Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i5-14600KF,en,i5 14th Gen
United States,5,A very good cpu! Run 5.6Ghz at 1.21v,5.6Ghz,Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i5-14600KF,en,i5 14th Gen
United States,5,"Updated the BIOS on my MSI Z690 Unify-X to accommodate this i5-14600KF, and was not disappointed.  This little CPU has scorched through everything I've thrown at it, faster even than the i7-12700k I just pulled out. Minimal investment for a system that benchmarks high. Also running Radeon 7900 XT, Seagate Firecuda 530 SSD, and Corsair DDR-5 36-36-36-76 Samsung B-Die.  It's a great time for PC computing.",Quite Impressive,Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i5-14600KF,en,i5 14th Gen
