United States,1,"I've been a lifetime Intel diehard fan but man they really pushed a disappointing product out. This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down.I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU.I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot. That's not the case anymore and I'm so disappointed because Intel was my go to with every single PC I ever built.",BEWARE of the New LGA 1700 Socket,Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i7-14700KF,en,i7 14th Gen

United States,4,"Wanted to purchase the unlocked version of the 20 core 14th gen processor and saw that this was a cheaper option at the time. All the description says is that ""Discrete graphics is required."" It would be much more helpful by adding a line that says the F version stands for no integrated graphics card. If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version.",Please note that the F in the 14700KF means NO iGPU,Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i7-14700KF,en,i7 14th Gen
United States,5,"A very powerful processor, but if it does not have good cooling, its functions will be limited. Currently it is working wonders together with the other components. But if they have a moderate cooling system, it is advisable to use the other brand of processors ""AMD"" that has half the temperatures, but with 10% to 20% less performance in some activities, and with the defects that come with not have an architecture that self-protects well or do not update its software often for better handling.Finally, I recommend the processor, only if you have a processor that does not meet current needs. My I7 6700k can do it all, but for some specific technologies, such as SSD Gen 4, peripherals with high-speed USB - C and others, it couldn't cope.",High TDP and Temperatures,Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i7-14700KF,en,i7 14th Gen
United States,5,"The i7 14700KF isn't just a CPU; it's a beast unleashed. This 20-core powerhouse purrs like a kitten under normal workloads, staying surprisingly cool thanks to its 7nm architecture. But don't be fooled by its initial demeanor  this CPU is a wolf in sheep's clothing, ready to tear through any demanding games and content creation tasks with ease, I paired with an rx 7900 xtx and forgot about frame rate drops and stuttering.",Great cpu,Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i7-14700KF,en,i7 14th Gen
United States,5,"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80. I'm using an EVGA CLC 280mm cooler. I may need to reapply thermal paste.",Powerful!,Pattern Name: ProcessorStyle Name: Core™ i7-14700KF,en,i7 14th Gen

This is because Windows 11 doesn't support your built in LAN/Wi-Fi drivers.The solution for this is to hitShift+F10 which will bring up the command prompt window.

United States,5,"4 more efficiency cores than 13700K for about the same price! If you worried about the heat and power draw, go into the BIOS and set the CPU max power draw to 253W which is the max power draw from Intel's website. By setting CPU max power draw to 253W in BIOS, my temperature went from 93c down to 82c in Cinebench 2024 stress test. Actually only draws 60-70w when I game.
