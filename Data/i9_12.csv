United States,5,"I recently got my hands on the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor, and I have to say, I am blown away by its performance. This processor is an absolute powerhouse, with 16 cores (8P+8E) and speeds of up to 5.2 GHz. It's also unlocked, which means I can push its limits even further if I want to.Installing the processor was easy enough, although I did have to make sure my motherboard was compatible with the LGA1700 socket and 600 series chipset. Once I had everything set up, I fired up my favorite games and applications to see how the processor would perform.The results were nothing short of impressive. The i9-12900K chewed through every task I threw at it with ease, from demanding video editing software to the latest AAA games. I was able to multitask without any lag or slowdowns, and my system felt incredibly responsive and snappy.The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load. I did notice a slight increase in power consumption compared to my old processor, but it's a small price to pay for the sheer performance boost.Overall, I am extremely satisfied with the Intel Core i9-12900K Desktop Processor. If you're a power user or a gamer who demands the best performance, this processor is definitely worth considering. It's not cheap, but in my opinion, it's worth every penny for the sheer power and speed it delivers.","The processor also runs surprisingly cool, even under heavy load.",i9 12th Gen,en
Japan,5,"I purchase this CPU 1 year ago and it cost me 74,000 JPY back then.the price didn't drop much since that time and the performance is satisfying so far.the new generation spec is higher so if you want to buy this CPU don't. instead, you can buy i7 Gen13 as it will have the same spec plus a better cache than the 12 Gen.it might be better to buy the K version in case you have issues with your GPU to troubleshoot.",all wat I needed for the next coming 5 years,i9 12th Gen,en
United Kingdom,5,Bought for a friend's computer I was building. I got it in the Prime sale and it's fantasticly fast,Great CPU,i9 12th Gen,en
Canada,5,This CPU has 24 threads and 16 cores (8E cores and 8P cores) which really makes difference when dealing with 3d graphics and to prevent bottleneck issuesDoesn't cause a CPU and GPU bottleneck as I only get about 45% GPU usage and stay under 10% load in most AAA titles like Destiny or Call of Duty.CinebenchR23 BenchmarksUsing CINEBENCH R23 I got a score of 27552 which is roughly 70 % of top performing CPU score of  43640.Using Geek Bench 6 testI got a Single core score of 2601 which is roughly 83 % of top performing CPU score of  3097 And a multi-core score of 12821 which is roughly 56 % of top performing CPU score of  21742,A performance Beast CPU,i9 12th Gen,en

United States,4,"Came packaged kinda poorly, and didn’t include the golden coin case, which makes me think maybe it was pre owned. When I opened the packaging though it had no paste on it and the pins looked brand new, so maybe they just don’t include it anymore since it isn’t the newest flag ship??","Works great so far, maybe pre owned??",i9 12th Gen,en
United States,4,"I bought this instead of the 12th gen i7 anticipating future demand for more cores. There is a price difference to consider. As many know, more cores doesn't necessarily mean better. Games only use a max of 6 cores, though it may vary from game to game. If you just want to game, buy the i7 series. My 4790k had served me so well, it's still my backup on my old mobo. It's been at least 5 years since I bought ol' reliable. She's been through rough seas. It was time for her to rest easy.For the i9, in terms of gaming performance, only CPU heavy games like RTS games will see any benefit. Multi-tasking also sees benefit, though that's limited to the hard drive it's working off of. Still, I expect great things in the far future.The packaging is a keeper to be sure, too.",So many cores to use!,i9 12th Gen,en
United States,4,"The 12900k can be hard to justify. The 12700k is around two-thirds the cost and the difference in performance is only a few percent. Furthermore, you can get away with a moderate cooling solution on the 12700k whereas the 12900k really requires a top of the line cooler which will set you back even more. Even while using the NH-D15 CPU cooler I decided to underclock the 12900k a little bit in order to keep thermals in check, bringing the performance nearer to the 12700k. Given the option to do it over, I would have just gone with a 12700k and saved myself about $250.",Not worth it over the 12700k IMHO,i9 12th Gen,en

United States,5,I only used laptops up to this point and this is my first PC build however I got this processor specifically for Workstation class computation and high performance gaming. The Core i9-12900K is blazing fast and uses very little watts for gaming mostly hovering around 65W~80W in the games I have played so far. It renders 3D projects at such a speed I hardly have time to do something else before it is complete which is a great change of pace. I would say the Core i5-12600K is better geared for gaming and this is much more geared towards production or enthusiast class gaming.

Canada,5,"This thing never goes over 15 percent usage, and most games its actually using 0-4 percent. Even on Escape From Tarkov at max settings 4k 140+ fps its using 4 percent at max and usually is at 0-1 percent, I don't know if it's my computer reading an error but I use a few apps to check including the task manager tab. I use an NZXT AIO and the temps on this thing are under 20 idle and when I'm gaming on any game it never goes over 45 and usually is in the low 30s. I tried WOW classic, Retail,  Cyberpunk, Spiderman , and regularly play Escape from tarkov and all at 4k max settings and this thing just stays cool and and low usage. My GPU barely works as I have a 3090 TI, my GPU is usually at USAGE 40-50 percent at max 60 percent and stays cool, so I don't think anything is bottle necking.My old computer has an I5 and I have a laptop with an I7 and when I am gaming they are usually at 90+ percent usage. Even my friend with the AMD 5800x3D was getting at least 30+percent usage for AAA games. This is the first Computer I've built where I'm actually not even worried about the CPU for how cool it runs.

As soon as I opened the shipping box I could tell it had been opened before. The edge was uneven and the label crease was loose. I put my X-acto Knife down (which is what you need or something similar to open these as the label is there for a reason) and with just the gentlest of pressure the label peeled away from the center where someone oh so nicely had finely cut the label horizontal to make it easy to fold one side back over the other and with just a quick once over it looked almost normal.If I hadn't opened a few of them already with Intel's fancy new packaging I probably would not have noticed but the way the packaging normally is, it is VERY precise, tight, even lines and you will not be easily or gently opening it up with a simple light finger pry.My biggest fear was there wasn't going to be a CPU in there at all but luckily the right CPU was in there that matched the container batch but if something is sold as new I don't do open boxes.Make sure to check your packages before opening. The seal should be nice and tight and straight. The edges of the back flap should be firm and secure against the other flap and the bottom line/edges should be even and exacting.Give a gentle pull on each corner of the box where the label keeps it sealed to make sure it hasn't been altered or tampered with.

United States,5,"This isn't the processor for everyone, but it is very fast. The individual cores aren't significantly different from those in the 13th generation i7. But if you have a need for a lot of parallel processing then this may be the processor for you. I do software development, which it doesn't help 99% of the time, gaming, which it helps a little, and occasionally transcoding large amounts of video and music. During transcoding it helps a huge amount. I have over 300GB of FLAC audio files that I ripped from my CD collection, I never buy mp3s. I wanted to have that on my phone, but I didn't want to carry it at full rate because I can't tell the difference in the car, so I transcoded it. I had done that once before and it took more than a day on a five year old Ryzen 7. This machine took around 30 minutes. 30-40 times faster. At work the optics team, which uses ray tracing software to design optical telescopes and laser focusing lenses, uses i9s in preference to Xeons. The Xeons might be faster under some circumstances, but the machines are hugely expensive, so the i9s are much better for price performance. Would I buy it again?

Canada,5,"I've only had it about a month, but so far it is complete overkill for gaming... I haven't seen it go above 50% pushing it as hard as I can other than stress testing lol. I bought it so hopefully in 10 years it can still do some stuff hahaha.",Thing is pretty nuts,i9 12th Gen,en
United States,5,"So far this thing is great! I upgraded from the 9900K and this has been a noticeable difference. I'm still in the process of updating drivers and reinstalling some software. I haven't done any overclocking so the Cinebench score and temps are straight stock settings.After seeing all the info on how hot this thing can get I added the Thermalright contact frame. It was a breeze to install. I watched the Gamer's Nexus video about this frame and followed their directions.For the motherboard I went with a MSI Z690 MPG Edge Wifi DDR4 so I could reuse my current RAM. I had to order a LGA 1700 bracket for the NZXT Kraken X73 AIO. I ordered both the frame and the LGA 1700 mount from Amazon and both arrived fast and were exactly what I needed.So far my temps are staying in the general range of my 9900K. I'm planning to do a little gaming this week with it so I'll have a chance to see how it does under my daily use. I also do a bit of Premiere and After Effects so I'm looking forward to seeing how it works there as well.Overall, this is probably way more processor than I NEED. I was still able to do what I needed to do with the 9900K. I built the 9900K in 2020 during the height of the astronomically high PC price wave. I ended up getting this processor for about $100 less than I paid for the 9900K two years ago. So the price-to-performance upgrade for me was a no brainer.If you want a fast processor at a reasonably decent price, this is a great one to get. Just be aware you will need to pay attention to your cooling.",Great Upgrade from 9900K,i9 12th Gen,en
United States,5,"It took me less than 15 minutes to take out my current 1700 series CPU (i7 12700K) and add in this new one.  Removed the AIO cooler, cleaned off the thermal paste, applied new past after inserting and wala' it's up and running like a champ.  I'm not a gamer, so yes I understand it's not a huge bump in performance for those applications. Video Editing is another story.","With the new price, this item (New CPU) is now a value",i9 12th Gen,en
United States,5,"Are usually go for the best products and it was a mistake for my first PC build I chose this chip and I didn’t know it runs that hot I built my PC I had enough fans but I had a 240 mm radiator I want a Micro Center and had to get a 360 mm cooler from the pool. The temps were at 89 to 92°C after the deep cool AIO under stress, test and bench testing the temp stay under 60°C , other than that I game hard on it and stream and the CPU usage never goes past 30%. It’s pretty overkill but that’s how I like my PC.",Be careful,i9 12th Gen,en
United States,5,"Purchased this for my new rig as opposed to an i7 based on price point at time of purchase (this was actually cheaper than the i7).Paired with RTX 4060TI 8GB.NO regrets.This can handle anything I throw at it, without issue (gaming wise) and never goes above 50/55C (not overclocked and cooled with 240MM AIO from Corsair) Idles around 32/33CVery responsive with plenty of clearance if I ever want to OC this guy.Heat was a concern after reading reviews and only having a 240MM radiator (sitting over a 4060Ti), but no issues - heat or performance) at all.Great time to buy with new gen just arriving recently.",12th Gen Top Tier,i9 12th Gen,en
United States,5,If someone ever asks you 'what is a GPU bottleneck' buy them a 12900k lmao.It's so good.,Beautiful technology.,i9 12th Gen,en
United States,5,"Purchased this CPU to finally upgrade my tired 8086k that I have had for close to 4 years now, and considering I also own a 3090 I was lucky enough to get last year, it was time. Paired with said gpu and a MSI Tomahawk Z690 with a Noctua NH-D15 Chromax Black cooler, this cpu runs complete marathons around my old 8086k. Certain games that would fully saturate my 8086k while also getting notifications from something like Discord would introduce very bad stutter, however those are completely eliminated with the 12900k. Temps are high when Im doing full resolution photo renders from my DJI Air 2S or Sony a6400 or straight up benchmarking, but that is expected and I'm not one to sweat about 80-90c temps, but if you are I would recommend the 12700k/5900x as they both run cooler and draw less wattage. However in gaming with multiple different Firefox tabs and discord/telegram open, it never even touches 70c, so your experience may vary depending on what type of work load you are doing. Make sure that if you do have a high powered gpu that you also have a high output power supply with a high efficiency rating as well, as my system can suck north of 600-750w full tilt (my power supply being a 1200w platinum EVGA that doesnt break a sweat under full load).",Amazing CPU,i9 12th Gen,en
