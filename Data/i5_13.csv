Canada,5,"Words cannot describe the change in performance.I thought my 9600k was still a decent chip before I upgraded. Now I see although it was decent, I was missing a lot. My rtx 2080 super didn’t get upgraded this year but I’m sure it’ll need to by next year as it’s now always peaked at 100% in games. While my gpu works a sweat trying to not burn itself to the ground, this 13600k sits around 20-30% usage and around 50 degrees Celsius in most situations.Depending on the motherboard, you may want to tweak “CPU lite load” settings. My MSI mobo defaulted to mode 12 and was causing overheating issues due to current. Now dialed back to mode 9, I have lost no performance what so ever, I actually gained almost a thousand extra points in cinebench by not letting it get hot.Overall I’m very happy and would highly recommend this cpu to anyone.",From 9600k to this.,i5 13th Gen,en

United States,3,"The Intel Core i5-13600K is the latest champion in the mid-range desktop processor arena, promising top-notch gaming performance and efficient multitasking. But does it reign supreme, or face dethronement by rivals? Let's sharpen our critical swords and delve into its strengths and weaknesses:Pros:Performance Powerhouse: 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) and 20 threads deliver exceptional performance for gaming, content creation, and demanding workloads. Compared to its predecessor, the 12600K, it offers a significant performance leap.Gaming Prowess: Tears through even the most graphically demanding games with ease, boasting high frame rates and smooth gameplay at 1080p and beyond.Multitasking Maestro: Handles heavy multitasking like a champ, effortlessly juggling multiple applications, browser tabs, and demanding tasks simultaneously.Overclocking Champion: Unlocked multiplier allows for enthusiast-level overclocking, squeezing even more performance out of the silicon for those seeking ultimate power.DDR5 and PCIe 5.0 Support: Future-proofed with support for the latest DDR5 memory and PCIe 5.0 technology, ensuring compatibility with cutting-edge hardware upgrades.Cons:Power Hungry Prince: This performance comes at a cost, with a higher TDP (125W) and potential for increased power consumption compared to lower-power alternatives.Temperature Tantrums: Can run hot under heavy load, requiring beefy cooling solutions to maintain optimal performance and prevent thermal throttling.Pricey Pedigree: Carries a premium price tag compared to some Ryzen 5 competitors offering similar performance in certain scenarios.Windows 11 Preference: While technically compatible with Windows 10, Intel recommends Windows 11 for optimal performance and feature utilization.Motherboard Matchmaking: Requires a newer LGA 1700 motherboard, adding to the overall upgrade cost.Verdict:The Intel Core i5-13600K is a force to be reckoned with in the mid-range gaming processor category. Its exceptional performance, overclocking potential, and future-proof compatibility make it a tempting choice for serious gamers and creators. However, the higher power consumption, price tag, and potential thermal issues require careful consideration.Overall Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars (with a slight temperature-related deduction)Should You Buy It?Absolutely! If you're a hardcore gamer or demanding content creator seeking the best value for performance in the mid-range, and aren't afraid of a little thermal taming, the 13600K is a top contender.Consider alternatives: If budget, power consumption, or Windows 10 compatibility are major concerns, explore Ryzen 5 options or consider the slightly less powerful (and cooler) i5-13500.",The King of Mid-Range Gaming?

United States,5,"Going from an old 4790K to this thing is like going from a biplane to the Concorde jet! This processor will crush any game out there. My main game is Flight simulator and the price to performance boost is outstanding. My old 1080SC is now the bottleneck in my system but both of them together makes even flying a helicopter in downtown New York, on multi-player, on ""high-end"" settings smooth as butter and the processor just sits at 55-60c! Amazing! The final piece of my new build was 32gb of corsair vengeance and I couldn't be happier unless I won the lotto.If you just need a solid gaming chip and don't want to break the bank, run, don't walk, to get this in your system today.BTW, I built my system using an ASUS ROG STRIX mITX, in an nr200p case and the Mugen 5 rev C does a great job keeping it cool using MX-6 thermal paste. The best part? It all fits neatly on my desk in my room. If you were waiting to build a new computer, now is the time.

When I'm putting it together, I can get the mother board assembly out without plugging in a GPU.I'm using this in a pc that primarily plays World of Warcraft. A core I5 is plenty for that. I'm sure an I3 is more than adequate. I'm using a Deep Cool cooler in a well ventilated case and it doesn't get above 72 degrees celsius, 51 degrees over ambient. I'm not a CPU snob and have used AMD and Intel equally over the years. I wanted thunderbolt ports and that pretty much limited me to Intel this go around. I am not disappointed.

United States,5,"There's really not much that needs to be said. If you're upgrading to 13th gen Intel, and don't require the additional non-gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k, you can't go wrong with the i5-13600k. Even with XMP enabled to 6000Mhz & a Noctua NH-U12A tower cooler on top, this beast never gets truly hot in any game. Granted, I have a very good case for airflow, but regardless it's extremely rare I ever see this CPU hitting the 70's when gaming (this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings), with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that. I paired this beastly CPU with the Sapphire Nitro Plus Radeon 6950XT & have been having an amazing experience all around. If you're deeply considering 13th gen, & your main focus is gaming, then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end SKU's give off. Genuinely give this CPU a 10/10, never in my life did I ever anticipate an i5 to be this great, but just goes to show it's more about the generation and less about the number after the i. If you're considering the CPU but unsure as to its performance, I promise you wont be disappointed with it one bit. Including with its temperatures.

I stood up a Plex docker container and added my footage and this CPU handles transcoding and streaming my videos no problem and it's great to go back and easily re-live some of those storms.We also have a growing library of TV shows and Movies and it also handles streaming those as well.I imagine this CPU would be awesome for gaming as well, but I don't have any experience with this chip and gaming but there are plenty of reviews that do go over that.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and would easily recommend this chip to anyone building a media server.","Very fast, Lots of Cores, Great transcoding",i5 13th Gen,en

At 70 fewer watts than the i9-13900K you can actually cool the thing on air and enjoy similar single core performance, and with a respectable multicore performance score as well.My chip actually runs faster than Passmark says it should, but that might be because of my RAM. I got the K chip to get faster DDR5 speeds, not faster clock speeds, since I'm on air cooled, but at 5.1GHz I'm not for want of more cycles.My last CPU was an AMD Ryzen 7 4750G. Respectable for its day, but when I saw the performance of this Intel I decided it was time for me to switch back.My recommendation is that if you're running an air cooled gaming system, strongly consider this chip even if you have the cash for a 13th gen i9.
