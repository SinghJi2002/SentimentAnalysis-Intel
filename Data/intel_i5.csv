United Kingdom,3,"This is a pretty powerful, modern Intel processor which I bought when replacing my gaming PC.On this front, me and Intel agree and are friends, it was in fact a powerful enough processor for most forms of gaming, which was easy to install.However, do NOT use the stock cooler that comes with this thing!If you just want to run your average PC game (FF14, Halo, etc) then you'll find it is strong enough to handle that without breaking a sweat.However, if you are intending to do video or photo editing, or God forbid emulation, then you'll find yourself with the loudest, most ineffective fan I have ever had the misfortune of witnessing.When I fast forward games in PCSX2, it can reach 90C which is 30 above what my previous computer's stock cooler would keep it locked at under any circumstances.I would tell you how hot it got trying to run RPCS3 but I immediately went for Task Manager to close the application after I saw it hit 100C!TL;DR: If you intend to use more than 30% of this processor's true capability, you cannot just use the cooler that comes with it.Extremely disappointing, and I'm kicking myself for not researching this more thoroughly, as I had erroneously thought from past experience that it could handle basic tasks without sounding like a helicopter taking off.",Do NOT use the stock cooler!,i5 12th Gen,i5

India,4,"The cpu is overall great for everything, it’ll give you flaw less performance in mediocre level video editing and hardcore level gaming and streaming. If you are looking to buy this just for gaming this is the perfect buy. But the only thing disappointing is the stock cooler. First of all I would like to request intel to please stop making this clip coolers they are so unreliable and annoying sometimes it fits sometimes it doesn’t. And also the clips are so fragile that you might break one someday trying to fit it just provide us with a simple screw and bolt cooler with a proper mounting. Also the performance is not nice, many would say stock cooler is more than enough for 12400f but in my case when rendering a video my cpu temps touched 100 degrees so I took out the cooler and reinstalled it to ensure proper installation but still it was going 90 to 95+Degrees. And it was approx the same case while gaming. Idk maybe my cooler clips are just faulty that the cooler is not able to mount properly and is not doing any cooling. So be careful with the stock cooler, or I would suggest to buy an after market cpu cooler or aio especially you live somewhere like India where it gets to 40 degrees easily and you don’t have an ac in your room, aio is the choice.",Great process but pathetic Stock cooler,i5 12th Gen,i5

United Kingdom,5,I've owned more expensive CPUs - up to AMD Ryzen 9 and Intel 13900K. In most cases these were overkill and ran hot with high wattages! Most of the work I was doing offloaded everything to my GPU so having a beastly CPU was a waste.I've downgraded to this CPU in my main desktop rig. It's great for productivity software (music and design work) as well as gaming. I have it paired with a RTX 4000 series card and haven't noticed a significant drop in frame rates whilst gaming. (maybe 1-5 FPS) In most games I max out the monitor's 144Hz/FPS at 1440p.One different thing about this CPU over other Intel offerings is that it has 6 performance cores (with 12 threads - hyperthreading) and no low powered efficiency cores. (they are only really needed for laptops anyway to save battery power!)The CPU is also very efficient and runs quite cool. Mine is 26c when idle and 26-30 light tasks such as browsing the web. During gaming - the temps are usually in the mid 50s. Benchmarking (such as Cinebench and Geekbench etc) reaches mid 60s. I am using a two-fan DEEPCOOL AS500 PLUS air cooler with three case 120mm fans.All in all - very happy with purchase and highly recommend! :),Bargain priced CPU - low power draw with great productivity and gaming performance! :),i5 12th Gen,i5

Combined with 4060 ti, consumes such little power and gets everything i need done so far.I got a noctua cooler for it though, works really quiet and cool. Perfect for the price.

Canada,5,"Words cannot describe the change in performance.I thought my 9600k was still a decent chip before I upgraded. Now I see although it was decent, I was missing a lot. My rtx 2080 super didn’t get upgraded this year but I’m sure it’ll need to by next year as it’s now always peaked at 100% in games. While my gpu works a sweat trying to not burn itself to the ground, this 13600k sits around 20-30% usage and around 50 degrees Celsius in most situations.Depending on the motherboard, you may want to tweak “CPU lite load” settings. My MSI mobo defaulted to mode 12 and was causing overheating issues due to current. Now dialed back to mode 9, I have lost no performance what so ever, I actually gained almost a thousand extra points in cinebench by not letting it get hot.Overall I’m very happy and would highly recommend this cpu to anyone.",From 9600k to this.,i5 13th Gen,i5

If you're upgrading to 13th gen Intel, and don't require the additional non-gaming related benefits of 13700k or 13900k, you can't go wrong with the i5-13600k. Even with XMP enabled to 6000Mhz & a Noctua NH-U12A tower cooler on top, this beast never gets truly hot in any game. Granted, I have a very good case for airflow, but regardless it's extremely rare I ever see this CPU hitting the 70's when gaming (this includes 1440p gaming at basically maxed settings), with plenty of utilization headroom on top of that. I paired this beastly CPU with the Sapphire Nitro Plus Radeon 6950XT & have been having an amazing experience all around. If you're deeply considering 13th gen, & your main focus is gaming, then the 13600k will perform up there with the best without all the additional heat the higher end SKU's give off. Genuinely give this CPU a 10/10, never in my life did I ever anticipate an i5 to be this great, but just goes to show it's more about the generation and less about the number after the i.

Absolutely killer value of you want to build a gaming rig with a quality processor that doesn't eat $600. I recommend getting the K version just in case for some reason one time you boot and your GPU doesn't read, your computer still has a gui. If you decide to go with an Intel processor, this is the best price to performance option.",Golden age of Gaming CPU's is back,i5 13th Gen,i5

United States,5,"I bought this CPU for a media/storage server I was building and I have not been disappointed. I am running Unraid OS with a number of Docker containers including Plex as well as virtual machines. Having 20 vCpus is awesome for some low requirement virtual machines and it's transcoding ability is great for Plex.A big reason I built a media server in the first place was to store my raw camera footage from storm chasing which is 4k 10bit which creates playback problems on a lot of hardware, it's just too large. I stood up a Plex docker container and added my footage and this CPU handles transcoding and streaming my videos no problem and it's great to go back and easily re-live some of those storms.We also have a growing library of TV shows and Movies and it also handles streaming those as well.I imagine this CPU would be awesome for gaming as well, but I don't have any experience with this chip and gaming but there are plenty of reviews that do go over that.Overall I'm happy with my purchase and would easily recommend this chip to anyone building a media server.","Very fast, Lots of Cores, Great transcoding",i5 13th Gen,i5

United States,5,"I LOVE THIS CPU. It's marketed as a value chip for the performance conscious gamer - at least in the reviews I've seen but that misses the mark. At 70 fewer watts than the i9-13900K you can actually cool the thing on air and enjoy similar single core performance, and with a respectable multicore performance score as well.My chip actually runs faster than Passmark says it should, but that might be because of my RAM. I got the K chip to get faster DDR5 speeds, not faster clock speeds, since I'm on air cooled, but at 5.1GHz I'm not for want of more cycles.My last CPU was an AMD Ryzen 7 4750G. Respectable for its day, but when I saw the performance of this Intel I decided it was time for me to switch back.My recommendation is that if you're running an air cooled gaming system, strongly consider this chip even if you have the cash for a 13th gen i9. You'll actually be able to keep it cool with a good cooler. I use a Noctua NH-DL12 with it and it's great.",This chip is a SCREAMER. Sleeper i5. Performs in the i9 tier. Get it.,i5 13th Gen,i5
United States,5,"I am extremally happy with this CPU. Blazing fast and very stable, runs supper cool. I am only running a dual fan cooler and it idles at 24c and when iRacing stays in hi 40's to low 50's. Only game/ Simulator I use is iRacing. I use some hi-tech 3d modeling programs.

United States,5,"This CPU runs real fast when paired with good RAM. I'm hitting 25,500 in cinebench r23 multi core workload. I manually overclocked it to 5.3ghz p-core, 4.6ghz e-core. It definitely produces a lot of heat, so make sure to get a big AIO or high end air cooler. You do not want to cheap out on a cooling solution or else you'll be leaving performance on the table.Only gripe with this cpu is the fact that intel markets this as a 14 core cpu, even when the e-cores aren't exactly a big deal in game. Those p-cores do real good work, but the e-cores are lacking. I don't like the $300+ price tag on this, but it does beat Ryzen 7000 series, so I'm satisfied with my purchase.",Hot and Fast,i5 13th Gen,i5
