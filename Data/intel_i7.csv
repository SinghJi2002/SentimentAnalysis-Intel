United States,4,"After too many years of gaming on an old i7-6700K I finally decided to pull the upgrade trigger this year.  I purchased the most up to date CPU and other components with the hope this one will last me as long as the last one did. Overall I think this is a great CPU, however it is a bit frustrating when you try to cool these things. Intel just keeps pushing these CPUs harder and harder to try and beat the performance metrics of AMD, but in the process they are making CPUs that are anywhere from near impossible to difficult at best to keep cool. After a lot of tweaking in the BIOS I finally got this one to stay below the 90 degree Celsius threshold, but that doesn't account for how hot it still makes my room when I'm gaming. The extra heat was kind of nice during the winter months, but as summer is approaching I'm wondering how this is going to pan out...Anyway, the CPU is completely as advertised and worked flawlessly out of the box. I didn't run into any errors or issues with this CPU. Overall I 100% recommend it because Intel has never let me down. I've been building my own systems for more than 20 years now too, so that's a pretty long track record of CPUs that just worked and never died. Because of that I can easily recommend this CPU and I would definitely order it again.","Great CPU, but hard to cool",i7 13th Gen,i7
United States,4,"I had a Ryzen 7 3800xt cpu for a while now so I went for a new upgrade and went for Intel for this generation. This processor works faster and better compared to what I had previously. This cpu is basicaly like an efficient i9 12900k, so if your looking for a high end processor just get this 13th gen. Also at this time the 14th gen i7 just got released but based on the reviews its more like a 13th gen Intel ks proccesor. That why I never went that route.",Worthy Upgrade For 2023,i7 13th Gen,i7
United States,4,I’m sure the chip works beautifully but I had no idea the k series didn’t come with a cooler which is very upsetting for the price point.

United States,4,"I got this for a new system build even though a little higher than I like to spend. But it has performed great.After, I noticed a drop in performance and doing research, I found out that these run very very hot and the thermal protection had kicked in to throttle the processor down. I tried a few Air cooled options that did the trick, but they were too loud for me, so I ended up with a Liquid cooled option which is what I would recommend to anyone using this processor. Currently, my idle temps are around 41c and at 100% utilization, temps average around 60-70 with a quick peak of 95. I dont personally like to overclock for my own reasons, but I did do some overclocking on this for testing and everything worked great with what I did. 13th Gen blows away 12th gen.

United States,5,"I bought this to replace my 10850k after I realized how much it was holding back my 4090.  I bought an ASRock z790 PG lightning /d4 board to go with it so I could use my existing DDR4 ram.  The difference was night and day!  I have an ID-Cooling 280mm AIO (cheapest I could find on Amazon) with a contact frame and kyronaut thermal grizzly extreme paste and does not thermal throttle on Cinebench R23 unless I run 3 or 4 passes back to back.  I am thrilled with how well this CPU runs.I was able to bump my DDR4 up to 4200mhz in gear 1 (timings cl20/26/26/26/48) after a bios update from ASRock and this thing is rock solid and crazy fast!  I get an average of 30500 in cinebench r23 and it will overclock as far as you want - I have taken it to 5.7 and it runs fine, it just thermal throttles quickly at that speed.  I'm pretty sure I could overclock this beast to the moon if I threw a lot more money into a custom cooling loop, but it is plenty fast as is.  I have no regrets about not bumping up to the 13900k, I do gaming and code compiling and it is a dream for both of those workloads.",Super Fast and temperatures aren't as bad as I expected,i7 13th Gen,i7

Canada,5,"This processor performs well and is a solid performance upgrade from my old i7-6700K. According to HWMonitor, the CPU package hovers around 15W power consumption doing desktop tasks (web browsing / email / Office).Compared to my i7-6700K (video card and PSU unchanged; new motherboard, ram, and heatsink&fan):- System power consumption at idle and doing desktop tasks is about 5W higher than my 6700K in normal mode, or about 15W lower in “eco” mode in my motherboard’s settings- Synthetic benchmarks (3dmark CPU Profile) indicate 2x performance for single-core processing and 4x performance for maximum threads- Real-life video encoding is roughly 3x faster using PowerDirectorNote that this LGA1700 socket is known to allow some bending (this causes poorer contact with heatsink which may cause throttling). This can be remedied by installing a pressure plate (I bought a Thermalright LGA1700-BCF for around $12).If you don’t need a built-in GPU, consider the i7-13700KF; the built-in GPU is nice to have but not always worth the premium.

Our test show it is about 9% faster than its same-numbered 12th generation.  The other thing we did see from our tests is that again 12th vs.13th the newer processor appears to run about 2°-3° C lower in temperature under somewhat similar conditions. All in all, obviously we will be doing our building going forward with 13 series processors we can't see justification for anyone taking their i9-12900k out and installing i9-13900k.

United States,5,"If you’re looking at this as a gaming-only processor, you’ll probably get 95% of the gaming performance this offers with the cheaper and cooler i5-13600k. Save your money and put it into a better GPU over buying this because that will actually result in more FPS where this processor (over the 13600k) will not.That being said, this processor is a monster. It’s a bear to keep cool but it has the performance to back it up.

United States,5,"Amazing CPU, noticed huge improvements in performance almost everywhere (faster load times, higher FPS in games, etc.) Performance was especially noticeable in CPU heavy games such as WoW, that don't require as much GPU power and are heavily bottlenecked by CPU. In cases like those I doubled FPS going from 9th gen to 13th gen Intel.One thing to note: 13th gen Intel is HOT! You may be coming from an older CPU and used to 60-70 C temperatures at max, then you might think you did something wrong when this one hits the lower 90s a lot. That's just how it is. If you're worried about longevity, set an undervolt offset of about -0.10 (preferably in your motherboard's BIOS settings) and the temps will drop by about 10 degree with no loss of stability.","Lightning fast, but runs hot",i7 13th Gen,i7

Everything opens almost instantly, whether it be Windows 11's File Explorer, Edge browser and webpages, and opening files in general.  I upgraded primarily because I am a developer, and Visual Studio + Dotfuscator would take almost 8 minutes to compile and obfuscate my largest program on my old build.  After upgrading, it now compiles in about 4 mins 45 seconds.  The longest part is Dotfuscator, not Visual Studio compiling.  Compiling happens in seconds on this setup.My components:MSI MPG Z790 Carbon WiFi Gaming MotherboardIntel Core i7-13700K Desktop Processor(this CPU)CORSAIR VENGEANCE DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 5600MHzMSI MPG A1000G PCIE 5 & ATX 3.0 Gaming Power Supply - Full Modular - 80 Plus Gold Certified 1000WCorsair MP700 2TB PCIe Gen5 x4 NVMe 2.0 M.2 SSDCooler Master Hyper 212 Halo White CPU Air CoolerMSI Gaming GeForce RTX 3060 Ti Graphics CardI don't game much, but there is a noticeable difference loading and playing Cities: Skylines after upgrading, too.I am very happy with the new PC.

United States,5,"I built a new computer during the height of covid (Dummy, I know, right?) and decided on a i9-9900k. I'm a sysadmin by trade, so remoting in and fixing servers has never been an issue with that processor..but for gaming..Titles like Cyberpunk, Days Gone, to even WoW..there were areas that my 3080 was being bottlenecked by the 9900k.I coupled this CPU with a MSI EDGE z790 DDR4 (I have fantastic Samsung B-Die CL14 3600 DDR4 from the previous build). So far, in Cyberpunk I'm seeing 25-30 more FPS on 1440p Ultra settings w/ Raytraycing on High. WoW is getting 50+ more FPS, and I'm getting over 100 FPS in Valdrakken, where I was getting 45-50 FPS with the 9900k with the same settings as cyberpunk (1440p ultra (10 graphics settings).I'm using the Corsair iCUE H100i Elite LCD 240mm AIO, with Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut Extreme thermal paste to cool this bad boy, and even at prolonged sessions in Cyberpunk, my temps are not getting above 65c. And no, I have not done the Contact Plate mod.TL;DR - This CPU is blazing fast, and if your current processor is a few years old it may very well be worth the upgrade. I don't claim to be Steve from Gamers Nexus, or a pro CPU tester - but I can tell you that this thing is amazing, and will serve you well for years to come.",Who needs an i9!

United States,5,"The i7-13700K has i7-12900K performance at an i7 range price range. Please note I used an older Z690 EVGA Classified Board. I was required to flash because older boards cannot support the new CPU yet. I suggest people who used a 12th gen chipset and were looking to upgrade follow their respective motherboard’s vendor manual. The installation was incredibly easy, and I booted the BIOS after the BIOS update without any problem. I had hit 5 GHz on the CPU without overclocking. It also supported 6000 MHz DDR5 RAM without any issues after enabling XMP. The reasonable pricing for Z690 or Z790 boards makes the i7-13700K a good combo compared to AMD’s expensive Ryzen 7000 CPUs and motherboard costs. For people who are still on older generations, the vast E cores and P cores offered by Intel’s 13th gen make it worth it to accomplish CPU-intensive tasks like Handbrake or Adobe Premiere. This CPU runs cool with a 360 mm AIO and a high airflow case (around 30-36 C idle temperature for me). I also like to note the CPU fits only fits one way and the CPU lever has a bit of tension, so don’t be afraid when installing your CPU.",Fantastic Performance/Value Workstation CPU,i7 13th Gen,i7

As of 2023, it's a razor-fast CPU for the average buyer - probably too powerful for anyone but power-users and video-editors. As for gaming, it'll run many older games at a high FPS even without any help from a GPU, and it handles modern titles without any problems, too.It CAN run with a low-power or stock-quality cooler for daily tasks, but I'd recommend investing in water cooling if you plan to throw heavy-duty loads at it, or good-performance air cooling if you're planning to buy it once and keep running it many years into the future.",Very Fast in 2023,i7 13th Gen,i7

The 13700k is the best value CPU if you require enough speed for high-end gaming + productivity (e.g. video editing/rendering, streaming, multitasking, etc). This thing is fast. I was able to undervolt it and overlock it to 5.5 Ghz (all p-core) and 4.4 Ghz (all e-cores). I could go higher if I wanted to spend more time on it, but this was a quick overclock. Perfectly stable and runs (relatively)cool with the undervolt.

United States,5,"In general - all mentioned in this review products are as described and working as described. Almost all deserve 5 stars (commented if one or more stars are taken off). Instead of reviewing item by item I decided to write one review for all products used for one specific PC build. The purpose of this PC build - fancy compact gaming system.Items used in this build:--Item 1) OCPC Mini ITX Case, Hydra Italy Mini ITX PC Case, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BK6D77DG/Very good case – compact, cool looking and efficient. The black color is the only variant I found on Amazon. With only cooling from top-down CPU cooler, the i7-13700K based system passed the stress test very well. Riser cable is not included – actually the riser cable for GPU orientation as shown on Amazon item photo does not exist. In order to build the system as shown, I bought a flexible riser cable (Item #2) and twisted it to 180°. Another simpler solution is to install GPU upside down as presented by other reviewers on Amazon.--Item 2) EZDIY-FAB PCIE 4.0 16x Extreme High Speed Flexible Riser Cable PCI Express Port GPU Extension Card-Dual Reverse Connector for ITX [21cm]. Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09S5DW3RX/-Does the job - exactly what I need for the project. Note: During system build I have to remove the bracket from the cable male connector and install it back after passing cable through the case hole.--Item 3) Power supply: Cooler Master V750 SFX Gold Full Modular, 750W, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08LP7B7FM/- Works as supposed to. PSU had a noticeable burning smell for about 5 days, considering this is normal for a new PSU. If you want to build more powerful gaming system, I recommend the PCIe 5.0 ready 850W SFX PSU, something like ARESGAME GL850 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHDS4J33/SFX-L PSU will work in Hydra Mini as well, but cable management will be tougher.--Item 4) CPU: Intel Core i7-13700K, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BCF57FL5/- Good CPU, working well in gaming.--Item 5) Motherboard: ASUS ROG Strix B760-I Gaming WiFi, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BR8TVLPL/- Working as described, nice looking MB. Thank you, ASUS - now ROG motherboards have the Memtest86+ built in BIOS. This very helpful feature allows PC builders to check memory before operating system installation and prevent blue screens and failures during OS install and system use in case of defective memory.In my case originally ordered CORSAIR DOMINATOR PLATINUM RGB DDR5 RAM 64GB (2x32GB) 6400MHz (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C1R95SPW/) was defective. Both memory modules came to life and showed ok in BIOS but Memtest86+ got errors. I did test modules one by one in the same memory slot and found out that one of the modules is the cause of the failures. Returned the defective memory and bought another from a different brand (Item #6). ASUS ROG Motherboard chosen for the look. In my opinion the best Intel (or may be overall) mini ITX MB on the market is MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/ ) I own one and have a very best experience.--Item 6) Memory: TEAMGROUP T-Force Delta RGB DDR5 Ram 64GB (2x32GB) 6000MHz, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BNTV1945/-Very good product, works as described, nice looking, recognized by Aura Sync.--Item 7) Graphics Card: MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4060 Ti 16GB, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CCFZMHSM/- Graphics card work as supposed to, have low power consumption. This GPU was chosen for the look only. Anyway, the presented system can play all modern games well at 1440p. But if you want the very good gaming experience, I will recommend at least RTX 4070 Ti like MSI Gaming GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Ventus 2X 12G OC. And the very best (talking about built on Hydra Italy Mini Case) will be the system with 850W PCIe 5.0 SFX PSU and:a)  MSI MPG Z790I Edge WiFi Gaming Motherboard, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BHCJ6KQ2/b) Intel Core i9-13900KF,  https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCFM3CJ4/c) ASUS ProArt GeForce RTX™ 4080 16GB OC, ( Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C75J66C8/). This compact GPU has included Graphics Card Holder which will work with presented builtI own all of these (a,b,c) components packed in another fancy mini ITX case (Phanteks PH-ES217A_BK02 Evolv Shift 2 Air Mini-ITX case, Fabric Side Panels) and they performed superb in games.--Item 8) SSD Disks:8.1) Primary (system): WD_BLACK 2TB SN850X NVMe Gen4 PCIe M.2 2280 WDS200T2X0E, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B7CMZ3QH/8.2) Secondary (backup and media data): Crucial P3 Plus 4TB PCIe Gen4 NVMe M.2 CT4000P3PSSD8, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B25M8FXX/- Very good products, works as described, no problems.--Item 9) Antec Power Supply Sleeved Cable, PSU Cables, PSU Extension Cable Kit / 1x24pin ATX / 2x8pin (4+4) EPS / 3X (6+2) pin PCI-E, 30cm Length with Combs, Dual EPS Red Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BN3H2K17/- Perfect fit for this project, good cables, looks nice.--Item 10)CPU cooler: ID-COOLING IS-67-XT Black 67mm Height Low Profile CPU Cooler, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CFPY9CKZ/- Good design, keeps i7-13700K adequately cool in open Air PC Case. Mounting for regular size 120mm fan included. Easy installation - just install radiator 1st and mount fan after. ID-COOLING IS-67-XT chosen because of black color. In my opinion DeepCool AN600 Low Profile CPU Cooler (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P8ZPWT/) has a little bit better cooling performance (I have one in a very compact Flex ATX build).--Item 11) EZDIY-FAB Moonlight 120mm RGB PWM Case Fan, Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07X8T79QY/Good, quiet and nice-looking fan. Actually, it is a leftover piece from a 9 fans ATX tower system build. If you want to build a similar system with a similar look, I recommend Cooler Master MF120 Halo² Fan Duo-Ring ARGB (Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0BWKZGYXJ/). This fan has a similar look but has better airflow / air pressure.---Item 12) 24 Pin RGB Cable Extension Kit (used ARGB strip only), Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07WN4G7KC/- The power cable connector to MB too tight - did not go all the way down, afraid to broke the MB if try to apply more force (the regular PSU cable fits perfect). Connector to PSU too tight as well, but was able to connect all the way down. Actually, in reality the system with this cable does not look good (too much RGB). Did use ARGB strip only for decoration purposes on the GPU side.--Item 13) Thermal Paste: ARCTIC MX-6. Optional - I have a very good experience using this thermal paste brand and always using it for the builds (so thermal paste provided by ID-COOLING was not used). Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09VDLH5M6/-----------Overall, I assume the goal is reached - the presented system can play recent games and look very cool (in my humble opinion).","Good CPU, working well in gaming",i7 13th Gen,i7

United States,1,"I've been a lifetime Intel diehard fan but man they really pushed a disappointing product out. This thing gets HOT, I've been building computers for a while but I've never seen a CPU regularly spike to 100 C with liquid cooling. My previous 8700k ran great and was fulling overclocked to 4.8GHz and I never saw anything higher than 78 C under 100% load. I was so sketched out by seeing the 14700k temps that I ran Intel's CPU diagnostic software and I couldn't even finish it! The temps got to a steady 93-100 C while testing so I had to cancel it and let the CPU cool down.I even tried some gaming with it and while playing Helldivers 2 at ""High/Medium"" settings It liked to hover at 95C and spiked constantly. This caused thermal throttling and game stutters followed with it. Even while at the desktop fully idle my temps would spike around from 25 C all the way up to 70 C. The reason for this is the new LGA 1700 socket ILM, you have to buy, replace, and correctly torque a WHOLE new socket brace just so you can kind of tame this CPU.I remember when Intel was known for keeping cool and AMD for getting hot. That's not the case anymore and I'm so disappointed because Intel was my go to with every single PC I ever built.",BEWARE of the New LGA 1700 Socket,i7 14th Gen,i7

If you're doing any kind of workstation work such as video editing, most software will take advantage of the processor having an iGPU as well and so I'm actually losing performance with this model version. I'll have to return the item to purchase the correct version without an F. I would give it a full 5 stars if it had the line explaining the F version.",Please note that the F in the 14700KF means NO iGPU,i7 14th Gen,i7

United States,5,"The i7 14700KF isn't just a CPU; it's a beast unleashed. This 20-core powerhouse purrs like a kitten under normal workloads, staying surprisingly cool thanks to its 7nm architecture. But don't be fooled by its initial demeanor  this CPU is a wolf in sheep's clothing, ready to tear through any demanding games and content creation tasks with ease, I paired with an rx 7900 xtx and forgot about frame rate drops and stuttering.",Great cpu,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,"I bought this as an upgrade from my trusty i9 10900k. I was worried the performance boost would be marginal but I was pleasantly surprised to get a solid boost on 1440p with my rtx 4080 super. Playing Helldivers 2, my fps went from mid 70s-90s to 120-140s at everything maxed out. Playing VR sims like il-2 and DCS has mostly eliminated little stutters and performance drops. Similarly, MSFS 2020 at ultra settings in populated areas provides a smooth and stable experience. My temps generally stay around 65 to 75 underload/demanding gaming. I have seen brief spikes to 80. I'm using an EVGA CLC 280mm cooler. I may need to reapply thermal paste.",Powerful!,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,1,"While you are installing windows, when you get stuck on finding a network but no networks are listed and it won't let you continue. This is because Windows 11 doesn't support your built in LAN/Wi-Fi drivers.The solution for this is to hitShift+F10 which will bring up the command prompt window. From here you typeOOBE\BYPASSNRO which will re-enable the ""I don't have internet"" option.This will let you continue installing windows.Now you can troubleshoot your network from windows.",Windows install wants a network but no network is listed,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,1,I received a processor in an Intel I box.No markings on the processor itself. Thermal paste residue still on the processor.  This is crazy!!!,Not sure what CPU I received,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,1,"Quality/silicon control on 14700k is chaos. What the hell intel thinking and doing I dont know.My 13600KF took 7400mhz ram like champ, while this thing cant get even 6800mhz stable... Very dissapointed.1.35v 300w in cinebench with 100c temps with arctic freezer 280mm (that beats most of 360mm AIOs) + bending corrector and good paste.TRASH.","Trash quality control, trash memory controller",i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,"No more lining up pins, now you just make sure this thing sits in the way it belongs and off you go! I've had an H170i on it the whole time but it barely gets into the 40's when under extreme load. For the price, the 14700KF is the way to go imho",So easy to install a baby could do it!,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,"I paired this with a ""GIGABYTE Z790 Eagle AX LGA 1700 Intel Z790 ATX Motherboard with DDR5, M.2, PCIe 5.0, USB 3.2 Gen2X2 Type-C, Intel Wi-Fi 6E, 2.5GbE LAN, Q-Flash Plus, EZ-Latch"" mobo and TGDGAMER ""T-240MM Black ARGB Liquid CPU Water Cooling with 240mm ARGB PWM Fan, Temperature Display, Computer Water Cooling"". The Intel application used AI to tweak my CPU to squeeze out more performance, but under 100% load it will often thermally throttle and sporadically hit 100C. I am considering finding a better cooler to keep up with this racehorse.",Runs HOT - Get a good cooler!,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,"New, great product, came as described and very fast at the same day!",Great product!,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,Works well on my new PC,Highly recommended,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,"Love the processor, got it new and using with a rtx 4090 for 1440p. Have it paired with a z690 formula board and I have the ai optimize the cpu. On a 420 cooler it gets 60c at best with warzone 3 with 240 fps. Fast and consistent,  on a 240 cooler Temps got up to 71-81c keep that in mind. Love my purchase!",Powerful cpu for gaming,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,I really enjoy the speed of this processor. IO would definitely use this again on another build. Didn't rate the gaming because I am not a gamer but I would expect it would be great for that as well.,Super fast,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,It was either this one or the 13th gen. I went with this one for the few extra bucks to stay up to date with things longer. Works great so far with no issues.,"Great so far, one gen newer with no real improvements.",i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,I love it.,Thank you.,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,High performance and high heat output. Make sure you have proper cooling for this one!,Performance!,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,"I use this for Gaming and Blender/Photoshop work... and for this need Stability, the last thing i need is a blue screen after 6 hours of rendering... I heard AMD has problems with memory/stability and i got a deal on a Mobo/Ram combo so i got this.... It delivers what i need in Both aspects mentioned.",Stability first and foremost...,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,"This CPU is extremely good. Base speed is 3.40 GHz overclocking speed is 5.6 GHz. L1 cache is 1.8 MB, L2 cache is 28 MB and L3 is 33 MB. Handles most CPU intensive games really well.",20 Cores with 28 Logical processors,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,"4 more efficiency cores than 13700K for about the same price! If you worried about the heat and power draw, go into the BIOS and set the CPU max power draw to 253W which is the max power draw from Intel's website. By setting CPU max power draw to 253W in BIOS, my temperature went from 93c down to 82c in Cinebench 2024 stress test. Actually only draws 60-70w when I game. Most of the time you will not use all the CPU cores so don't worry about power draw.",Great CPU for the price,i7 14th Gen,i7
United States,5,"I have used this for my build and 3 others, didn't realize what the F is for...Get the K, it's not much more and worth the extra. That being said, this beast will do everything you want it to do and more.",GET THE 14700K,i7 14th Gen,i7
