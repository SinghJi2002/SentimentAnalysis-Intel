Australia,5,Item arrived from Germany to Australia in reasonable time.Parcel required signature on delivery.Packaging adequate to protect the goods.,Genuine intel cpu,i9 13th Gen,en
Sweden,5,"It does the job, but it does get hot. Running Blender at 100% CPU is going to make a lot of heat, even with a big radiator.",A beast that generates heat.,i9 13th Gen,en
United Kingdom,5,"I installed this CPU a month or so ago now, alongside 64gb RAM, on an ASUS TUF Gaming Motherboard.The TLDR; It's lightening quick, and It's super easy to install. As with all CPU's care should be taken when installing and handling the CPU, but other than that it's relatively straight forward.All I have to say, is this CPU is a beast. Like its so overkill for the average user. In for gaming it is just overkill. It is the perfect CPU for me, but also for those who do intensive work loads, such as running running large data models for AI purposes.My particular use case for this CPU was to allow me to build a virtual lab to which I could analyse malware in an virtual sandbox, whilst also emulating real world hacking attacks. At present I am able to run several virtual machines with no performance issues. As you can probably imagine, this power hungry beast can get warm, but with an adequate cooling solution, there should be no issues in keeping the PC nice and cool.  I have paired this CPU with an AIO, and also additional fans for the case to ensure there is a lot of air flow to ensure that the thermals are a good temperature.My advice to anybody purchasing this CPU - go for it - it's well worth the investment, while at the same time you'll be future proofing your soon to be BEAST of a machine for the next 10 years.",Its a BEAST,i9 13th Gen,en
Netherlands,5,I use it with a BeQuiet Dark Rock 4 Pro cooler and very rarely do I see thermal throttling even when gaming.,"Proper beast, no major heating issues",i9 13th Gen,en
United Kingdom,3,"80 c when gaming on some demanding titles.... sheesh especially when i paired it with a 660f like a moron. and not its not my cooling, probably far more expensive than yours. so im guessing deficient",Hot asf even with good cooling,i9 13th Gen,en
Germany,4,"works very well, but heats up a lot so you have to provide good cooling",very hot,i9 13th Gen,en
United Kingdom,5,Good chip for 3d work or gaming.,Good choice,i9 13th Gen,en
United Kingdom,5,"Fast, capable and stable. Does run a bit hot but coupled with water cooling allâ€™s good.",Banging processor!,i9 13th Gen,en
Germany,5,"Best high end CPU for the money (as of time of writing this review, the 7950X3D is more expensive, not as widely available, and has strange gimmicks with Xbox Game Bar, so I avoided it). Despite all the news of it running extremely hot and hitting 300W, you can actually change this in your BIOS. On my Asus board, the default setting boosts it to ~310W for a short while causing 102Â°C on my 360mm Arctic AIO before dropping to something more reasonable. YOU CAN DISABLE THIS and enforce Intel stock 250W limits. Doing this led to no throttling and no crazy 100Â°C moments. This is not an inferno of a chip, your motherboard makes it one, so carefully check your BIOS settings if that bothers you!I'm happy that this chip does phenomenally in gaming and productivity both, so I can easily recommend it. (also, the packaging is pretty cool)","Fast, but not hot!",i9 13th Gen,en
Germany,5,"A great modern CPU with beastly power, the13900K takes the best from Alder Lake and amplifies potential by a great margin! It adds more cores, larger cache, much faster memory and sky high frequencies. Really great multi-core scores and the performance results in gaming are fantastic which make the 13900K the worldâ€™s best gaming processor.The 13900k I am using produces an ""ok"" SP score of 99 on the ASUS Z790 Extreme but that doesn't mean it doesnt clock great . In my case just using AI tuning, the ""out of the box"" clocks I got were 6100ghz with 1.390v stable (both of these numbers will improve with custom overclocking).The temps are 34-39c idle and a max gaming temp in the area of 58-64c, those temps are with a Lian-Li Galahad 360 AIO cooler and TG kryonaut Extreme thermal paste.Total power consumption in every day usage and gaming never exceed 130 watt and total system power draw (Including a 4090) in everyday usage is around 140-145 watt (picture included on power supply maximum draw).",Intel is back with serious performance improvements.,i9 13th Gen,en

United Kingdom,5,First 1 that arrived was oddly dead on arrival but ordered a second and got it installed today. Can't believe how fast it is. It requires a fair amount of bios tinkering to get the voltage under control but once you get it into a more sane temperature range its a monster.,Whoa,i9 13th Gen,en
Germany,5,"The best CPU you can get at the moment value-wise. Initially looking for the 13900KS, but switched to 13900K for the money value.I don't regret it.Very stable, very good at multitasking and gaming at the same time. Tops out all performance and stress tests. Paired with AIO Ryuo III cooling on Z790-E ROG motherboard.",TOP performance,i9 13th Gen,en
United Kingdom,5,"A complete beast of a processor, with a 360 aio it idles around 30C in my Corsair 7000D airflow, don't listen to the rubbish about it running at 100C all the time, that only happens when benchmarking, as it destroys benchmarks",A beast,i9 13th Gen,en

United Kingdom,1,"Dont buy this CPU you'll run into numerous BSOD, applications crashing, games closing without warning.Seller refused RMA even though the issues I mentioned have been happening since day 1.Returned to Intel (Took 2 weeks to arrange, a LOT of hassle) and received a replacement after a day = no more issues.",CPU arrived faulty.,i9 13th Gen,en

United Kingdom,1,"CPU arrived in packaging seal but the CPU is clearly used, not only that, the CPU itself has been delidded and replaced with Intel Celeron G6900. I did some troubleshooting including updating BIOS to the latest version, uninstalling the processor devices from device manager. But all evidence point to this being a scam!",Beware of Scam!,i9 13th Gen,en
United Kingdom,5,"CPU working just as it should be. People's main concern with this product is obviously the temps. To reassure people, and from a VFX artist's perspective, my temperatures are respectable. I have the Corsair H170I ELITE CAPELLIX 420 mm AIO attached to it. When running tasks like having Opera open with even 30 tabs, Spotify, file browser and settings all open at the same time, my temps max at 34 degrees Celsius. When I'm in Unreal engine it never goes above 45 (but yes it is mainly GPU real-time rendering). it will use around 10 % of the CPU still however. in Cinema 4d viewport it will never go above 34c, when rendering a 4k 3d scene it ranges from 70-86 degrees Celsius max. whatever software I'm using whether it's Adobe software, c4d, unreal, Houdini, Davinci, it will never hit over 90c.Installation was absolutely fine and considering this was the first ever system I've built, so it demonstrates how easy it was to put into the motherboard if you just follow instructions to a tee. The H170I also comes with pre-applied thermal paste so I didn't even have to worry about that which was a bonus. and it's obviously doing its job at transferring all that heat.My clock and boost speeds are normal too.my PC specs FYImsi meg ace z7904090 suprim xi9 13900kH170I cosair AIO",Working perfectly,i9 13th Gen,en

Germany,5,"Ok I have gone from 11900k to this BEAST and believed or not this CPU, combined with Maximus Apex, TridenZ 7600Mhz and Arctic Freezer II 360 push-pull with Noctua Industrial PPC, contact frame and Thermal Grizzly thermal paste 2.5 times faster than 11900k.Cinebench R23 did hit 40k score! Some people get this score with 13900KS which is also overclocked!This is really big jump from my previous setup and it's only 2 generations apart.This is totally worth upgrade, and if you play FPS games, like PUBG, you will be amazed!Like I play PUBG in 2k res. with ROG Strix 3080  v2, I get all game between 250 and 500 FPS depending on situation, while before I was in the range sometimes 85 FPS and sometimes 300 FPS, but with 13900k never gone down below 250FPS. My monitor is ROG 240Hz 27' 2k.You will not regret if you buy this CPU!",Still the BEAST!,i9 13th Gen,en
United Kingdom,5,"Despite long delivery distance, came in perfect condition. It is one powerhouse of a cpu, only thing to bear in mind is that it does run pretty hot",Great processer,i9 13th Gen,en
Germany,5,"intel shocked us all with this one! I am an AMD fan for sure but this CPU brought me back to the intel platform. This thing is amazing. Fast, cooler than rivals, and an amazing over-clocker for those who like to do so. I ran extremely demanding games and applications ... this thing was just cruising at 29C!! Highly recommended!!",What a beast!!,i9 13th Gen,en

United Kingdom,5,"I upgraded to this from an I7-4790K and while i was pleased with this I am even more impressed with it once installed. Happy with it but I will note that it does get hotter than my previous I7, the i9 can be tamed with a decent (not over the top) AIO despite the media screaming its head off that this is a volcano.",Lightning Speed,i9 13th Gen,en

United Kingdom,5,"Upgraded from 9900k to 13900k and Iâ€™m very happy with my decision. As much as I loved my 9900k, unfortunately it was dragging my RTX 4080 down and was getting bottlenecked. Keep in mind this is a HOT cpu though. I thought my 9900k was already hot but after installing 13900k, itâ€™s definitely running about 10c hotter on my 360 AIO. I still havenâ€™t touched the manual overclock as this cpu auto boosts to 5.5ghz",Pure power,i9 13th Gen,en
